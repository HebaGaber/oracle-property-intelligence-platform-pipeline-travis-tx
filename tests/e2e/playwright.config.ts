//
// - Every spec runs against RUNTIME_URL only. Loading this file throws exactly
//   `RUNTIME_URL must be a hosted URL, not localhost: {value}` for a loopback URL and exactly
//   `RUNTIME_URL is not set; set it to the hosted URL` when it is unset (TC-060, lib/runtime-url.ts).
// - One test per G6 test case, titled `@scenario:A-03-TC-nnn`, in the spec file the G6
//   coverage matrix names; `npx playwright test -g "A-03-TC-nnn"` runs one case.
// - Cases that use an AWS profile (lib/aws.ts) also carry `@needs-aws` in their title. Under
//   CI without AWS credentials they are excluded with `grepInvert` and a stderr notice, never
//   reported as passed (lib/needs-aws.ts). Everywhere else they run.
// - Config keys the specs read from the environment: CID_COPY_HOST (required by the specs that
//   read the copy directly), FILEBASE_GATEWAY_HOST, PINATA_GATEWAY_HOST, READPATH_PRIVATE_PREFIX
//   (lib/runtime.ts). The AWS region comes from the profile configuration, never a literal.
