// Human labels for the contract's closed list of missing reasons (spec.md § Missing-reason
// labels, FR-011; PO decision D-2, 2026-10-21). The contract defines no labels: these are the
// UI wording, one row per reason, and the UI shows them wherever a value is missing (XI).
// Also the fixed Runs/Permits texts of plan.md § "Fixed texts and config keys" (T081): this
// file is the only source of those strings; apps/web imports them, never retypes them.

// Adding a reason to contract/v1 is additive and must add a row here. `satisfies
