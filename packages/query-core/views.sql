-- T060 (A-02, FR-002 / FR-007 / FR-009): the four contract/v1 views.
-- Bound by bindManifest() (src/bind-manifest.ts), which first creates:
--   meta.run, meta.source, meta.group_source, meta.part, meta.jurisdiction_host, meta.zcta_area;
--   county.<table> and property_improvement.<table> over export-tables output (each with _part);
--   travis_austin_status_map (generated from the profile) and the macros in src/derive.ts.
-- Rules: columns, order and types are packages/contract/src/columns.ts; joins go only through
-- relationship tables (from_cid / to_cid); roofing is enum equality on improvement_type and
-- improvement_action; status_class comes only from the generated status map on (jurisdiction,
-- improvement_status); every derivation is a derive.ts macro over meta.run.as_of (the manifest
-- finishedAt); every empty value gets a {field, reason} entry in `missing`. Records are read
-- once per cid and edges once per (from_cid, to_cid), whatever the number of parts.
-- Address properties are not in the export (ADR-0002), so the address-only fields appear in
-- `missing` as not_in_export. The owner mailing ZIP is read through meta.address_zip, which
-- bindManifest fills from address.postal_code when the export carries it (it does not yet: Run 2
-- exports address with identity columns only), and stays empty otherwise.

-- One row per (permit, property edge) of a published county property, with its jurisdiction
-- (request host → profile jurisdiction map) and its status_class. Shared by v_property (roof
-- anchor) and v_roofing_permit.
