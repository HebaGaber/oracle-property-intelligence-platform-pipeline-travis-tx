# CountyLens: design handoff for implementation

**Product:** CountyLens, a list-first explorer for public property, permit, owner and contractor data in Travis County, TX. The map is not Task A scope (it is reused in the Roofing CRM, Task B).
**Domain:** countylens.aldarraj.com
**Design system:** Atlas (Material 3). No new design values: anything Atlas lacks is built from Atlas tokens and logged in §8. Corner radii use `--md-sys-shape-corner-*` only.
**Clickable prototype:** the CountyLens canvas artifact (claude.ai). Open `Main.dc.html` (site map) and use the round prototype menu on any board to switch device or jump around. The same menu has the prototype-only **Map view (CRM preview)** switch, off by default (§1, Map view).
**Prototype source:** `prototype/` in this package. One `.dc.html` file per board, plus the Atlas tokens and components CSS and the CountyLens extensions (`ds/countylens/a11y.css`, `tablet.css`, `compact.css`).
**Handoff date:** 2026-10-18, revised after seven design-review rounds (88 points; see `design-review-log.md`) · 97 boards · every button and link checked to work, with the map switch off and on.

> How to read the prototype source. Each board is HTML in an `<x-dc>` template with `{{holes}}`, `sc-for` and `sc-if`, and logic in a `DCLogic` class. Treat it as a behaviour and layout reference, not as code to port. Port the logic, not the numbers: the sample records, run data and counts are fixtures (review #14).

---

## 1. Ground rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Sample data | Every number that is not from a real source is labelled **Sample** in the UI. The prototype's demo sample data is accepted for the design (review #30). In the build, test fixtures are labelled as fixtures and never reach the hosted app; "Sample" labels are removed only where real data replaces them (#14). |
| Coverage | Travis County, TX is the only live county. Other counties and states show as **Coming soon**, muted, with no counts and no "Notify me" (#20). |
| Sources | TCAD (properties, owners and sales, parcel geometry) · Austin open-data permits (`3syk-w9eu`, City of Austin only) · **TX Comptroller franchise-tax (`9cir-efmm`)** for businesses · **Overture** for places · contractors derived from permit names · BBB ratings (#28). |
| BBB | **Blocked in Run 3.** One wording everywhere (cards, Coverage, AI, MCP, Runs): "BBB: Blocked · 403 on 2026-10-17 · where available", linked to the fetch-log evidence. Never blank, never "no rating" (#37). |
| Roof age | Always an estimate, shown with its **basis** (reroof permit, then new build, then year built) and a **confidence** badge (High / Medium / Low). |
| Proof | Every value can be traced: source → capture time → run → CID, with copy and Verify. Results show coordinates and a source link (#23). |
| Public vs admin | The app is public by default and **the demo needs no admin access**. **Only admins can sync**: Start / Stop / Retry run and Activity appear only after **Admin sign-in** (email code, no self sign-up), which sits at the end of the main navigation, and carry an Admin flag (#19, #41). AI mode shows each visitor a **quota of 10 questions per session** (sessionStorage), visible all session; failed, paused or throttled questions and chip edits do not count; sign-in for more questions is **coming soon** (#58, #66, #79). |
| Map view | **Not Task A scope.** CountyLens ships List view only, with no view switcher (PO, round 5: the disabled 'Map · Soon' segment is removed). The map exists in the prototype as a CRM preview behind a prototype-only toggle. Do not build the map, the toggle or a feature flag for it. (#74, #78) |
| Coming soon | Builder mode (#21, #46), Street View (#17), AI-user sign-in (#66), the Roofing CRM card until Task B is live (#45). Each carries a **"Soon"** marker where it is listed (Builder: in its panel note and the mobile switcher badge, not on the rail). Builder and AI-user sign-in keep their prototypes so the design is ready; the others are disabled and point to a working alternative. **Not in this list:** Map view, map hexagons and map layers are **CRM preview only; no CountyLens marker; not Task A** (#22, #74, #82). |
| Principles | **P1** Everything in one place · **P2** Proof behind every value · **P3** Answers, not dead ends. |
| Six states | Every data screen handles loading, empty (with a hint and one next step), error, partial data, rate-limited and populated. |
| Breakpoints | 390 (mobile), 768 (tablet), 1440 (desktop): **every screen has all three** (#8, #9). Atlas tokens: compact < 600, medium 600–839, expanded ≥ 840. |
| No inner scrolling | At every size, the Explore query panel and results panel fit without scrolling. Results page instead (§4.1.6). |
| Touch targets | **48 px** is the build rule (#16). |
| One source of counts | Every count on Coverage, the Ownership row, Reconciliation and the MCP `get_coverage` tool comes from one `coverage.json` (merge figures from `merge_stats.json`) (#34). |
| Scope rule | Anything beyond the README requirements either ships with labelled sample (test) data that shows the intended experience, or is marked **Coming soon**. Content that must be dynamic (counts, dates, CIDs, URLs) is wired in implementation. |

## 2. Architecture (hybrid, review #1)

These are design constraints. Engineering owns the final choices; record the hybrid in the architecture constitution at G3. **There is no query database**: data lives in published Parquet. The only hosted state is one on-demand DynamoDB item per UTC day that counts AI spend ($0 idle) (#67).

| Runs in the browser | Runs on the server (Lambda: tRPC, and MCP's own handler) |
|---|---|
| Explore queries (Filters, SQL), Verify, Coverage, Runs and Data screens | The AI agent (D-10, D-11), MCP (D-12), IPNS resolution |
| **DuckDB-WASM** over CID-addressed Parquet: CID-named copy first, public gateway fallback (#64, #84) | DuckDB over the same published Parquet |
| **Free-form SQL runs only here** | Fixed, parameterised tools only; no free-form SQL |

- Both sides share one **`query-core`** package: view definitions, bound parameters, filter definitions and the SQL checks (§4.1.3).
- **Published data.** Each run writes Parquet plus `manifest.json`, `schema.json`, `runs.json`, `coverage.json`, `runs/<id>/events.json`, `cost.json`, `merge_stats.json`, a lineage view and slim geo-sorted serving Parquet (derived from `elephant-cli export-tables`). No map `tiles/` directory: map tiles belong to the CRM (#78). These outputs belong in stories A-02 (data contract) and A-11 (publication) (#32). Earlier CIDs are never changed (D-7).
- **Views exposed to SQL and MCP:**

  | View | Rows | Columns |
  |---|---|---|
  | `v_property` | 412,860 | `address`, `lat`, `lon`, `roof_age_yrs`, `roof_age_basis`, `centroid`, `owner_out_of_area`, `owner_mailing_city`, `last_sale_date`, `tenure_yrs`, `source_url`, … |
  | `v_roofing_permit` | 22,083 | `permit_id`, `parcel_id`, `status`, `issue_date`, `expiry_date`, `open_days`, `final_date`, `contractor_name`, … |
  | `v_contractor` | 18,240 | `contractor_id`, `name`, `bbb_rating`, `bbb_status` |
  | `v_run` | 3 | `run`, `manifest_cid`, `published_at`, `roll_pct` |

  Bound parameters: `:area_centre`, `:radius_mi`. Helper function: `dist_mi(centroid, :area_centre)`.
- **Places gazetteer.** Area search needs Census places and ZIP centroids. Add a gazetteer artifact to the A-02 data contract (#30).
- **Verify (D-6).** Fetch a **file** artifact under about 50 MB from two public gateways: lane A **ipfs.io** and lane B **dweb.link**, the pair the README names (#69). Both are operated by **Interplanetary Shipyard**, and each lane shows its operator; neither is run by CountyLens. **Filebase stores and pins the files**; Filebase's own gateway is **never** one of the two lanes (#26). w3s.link is not on the demo path. Fetch **by the plain file URL** (`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>`, `https://<cid>.ipfs.dweb.link/`), never `?format=raw`, which returns one block (#35). Hash as a stream with **hash-wasm** or **@noble/hashes** (WebCrypto cannot hash in chunks) and compare with the manifest's size and SHA-256. Directories and files over 50 MB show **Verify via CAR**. Each lane prints the exact URL fetched. A rate limit counts as pending with a countdown, never as a failure. Verify always uses the public gateways, never the CID-named copy (#64). **Gateway spike (#69, implementation):** early in A-02, test one real Filebase-pinned CID on ipfs.io and dweb.link (CORS, Range, subdomain redirect, rate limits).
- **Activity log.** Server-side events only (AI questions, MCP calls, Try a tool, search), written to **CloudWatch Logs** (`/countylens/query-log`), kept 30 days, no personal data. Filters, SQL and Builder run in the browser and are **not logged**; the page says so (#18, #43). Admin only.
- **Agent.** Turns a question into tool calls and shows its steps, citations and assumptions. Conversation memory is kept on the client; a follow-up such as "near that area" reuses the previous area (#24). It must say what data is missing (for example BBB) rather than invent it.
- **MCP.** `https://countylens.aldarraj.com/mcp` is its **own stateless Streamable HTTP handler** (a Lambda behind API Gateway) that shares `query-core` with tRPC, with CORS and Origin checks. It is **public and read-only**, with no token, and **throttled** by the API Gateway stage rate limit and reserved Lambda concurrency (no per-IP WAF rules, which would add cost). Throttled calls return `429`. **Try a tool** calls the same endpoint; the prototype's sample response must not ship (#2, #44, #57).
- **Shareable URLs.** Explore state lives in the URL, for example `/tx/travis/explore?at=30.4394,-97.6200&r=5&roof=15&permit=open,stalled&tenure=10&ooa=1&sort=open_desc&sel=p_101`, plus `mode=filters|sql|ai`, `view=list` and `place=<id>`. **Area = `place` or `at`:** a picked place writes `place=<id>`; a free centre writes `at=lat,lon`; both round-trip with `r`. The back button must work. CountyLens has List view only: a `view=map` URL falls back to List (#74, #88).
- **Sign-in and run commands.** Cognito user pool with the built-in **email code** (SES) for admins only, self sign-up off (#41); the AI-user variant is coming soon (#66). Start / Stop / Retry go to an **SQS run-command queue** with a command ID. A small **local bridge** on the pipeline host long-polls the queue with scoped IAM credentials (the SSM agent does not read SQS), acknowledges each command when it picks it up, and drops commands older than **15 minutes** so a stale Start never fires later. **Cancel** sends a cancel message keyed by the command ID; the bridge skips that command if it has not started. If nothing acknowledges within 60 s the UI shows "Host offline" (#42, #56).
- **Serving files (#36, #64).** Queries (browser DuckDB and the Lambda agent and MCP) read the slim, geo-sorted serving Parquet from an **immutable copy named by its CID** (Amplify or S3, bytes checked against the CID at release), with HTTP range reads, so they look instant on camera. If the copy fails, the browser falls back to a public gateway; a Lambda fallback fetch is labelled "via server". The loading state shows MB of the needed columns, never a 400 MB download.
- **Cost (#7, #40, #55).** `cost.json` lists **every** deployed resource with its idle cost: Amplify Hosting; S3 (`runs/live.json` and the CID-named copies, < $0.01); API Gateway + Lambda (tRPC and the MCP endpoint); model API calls; the IPNS publisher (a Lambda step after publish); SSM Parameter Store (IPNS key and config); Cognito; SES; SQS; CloudWatch Logs; **Route 53 hosted zone ($0.50 a month) + ACM certificate (free)**; Filebase pinning (free tier, 5 GB); GitHub Releases (CAR copies, free); the public gateways ipfs.io and dweb.link (free, run by Interplanetary Shipyard, not ours); the local pipeline. Idle total: about **$0.51 a month**, the hosted zone being the only fixed cost.
- **AI spend (#58, #66, #68, #71, G3).** Server-side protection: a daily spend counter (the DynamoDB item above) with the provider's prepaid credit as the hard ceiling, about 6 steps and 1.5k output tokens per answer, a route throttle, reserved concurrency of 3–5 for the agent Lambda, and an alarm at 80% of the daily cap; size the cap for evaluation days. The visible quota is **10 questions per session**, kept in `sessionStorage` and shown beside Find and in the results tab bar. Only answered questions count: failed, paused or throttled questions do not, and a chip edit that re-runs the query without a model call does not count and costs nothing (#79). When the daily budget is used up, AI mode pauses until 00:00 UTC and says so; Filters and SQL keep working. If `agent.ask` streams through a Lambda Function URL, the API Gateway stage throttle does not apply, so reserved concurrency and the budget counter are the protection; record this at G3, or stream through API Gateway REST streaming. **Model provider (#73, #88):** Vercel AI SDK, provider set by `AI_PROVIDER` (`bedrock` or `gateway`); confirm quota before A-14. Optional: cache answers per run CID and question for 24 h, labelled "cached answer from {time}".
- **Demo city check (#38).** During A-02, count real roofing permits inside the Pflugerville 5 mi ring (Austin permits cover the City of Austin only). If the D-11 answer would be thin, move the demo centre to a place whose ring is mostly City of Austin, for example ZIP 78753.

The 768 and 390 versions of the data screens wrap the 1440 page with one shared rule each (`tablet.css`: rail plus one column; `compact.css`: one column, bottom nav, charts as tables, tables as key–value cards below 600 px). Build the same rules with container queries.

## 4. Screens

### 4.0 App shell

- **Top bar (768+):** wordmark · location chip "Travis County, TX ▾" · search box · run badge **"Run 3 · {date}"** (opens Runs; Stale only for real staleness, #13) · Help menu · **Ask** · Apps (opens the hub).
- **Top bar (390):** wordmark plus icon buttons for location, Help, Ask and Apps. The search box sits below the bar.
- **Navigation, 768 and 1440:** rail with Explore, the query modes nested under it (Filters, Builder with Soon, SQL, AI), then Runs, Coverage, Data, and **Admin** at the end (opens Admin sign-in; reads "Signed in" for admins). **Activity shows only when signed in as admin.**
- **Navigation, 390:** bottom bar with Explore, Runs, Data and More. More holds Coverage, Help, MCP docs, Admin sign-in and the legal pages (Activity only for admins).
- **Help menu:** Help, What can I ask?, MCP and API docs. Admin sign-in moved to the main navigation. Signed in, an **Admin** pill sits in the top bar.
- **Ask:** on Explore it switches to AI mode in place and focuses the question box. Everywhere else it opens Explore in AI mode.
- **Sync badge states** (`ShellStates`): Fresh, Running, Stale (more than 8 days old), Failed, Never synced.
- **Location picker:** pick a state, then a county. Only Travis is live; the rest show "Coming soon".

### 4.0.1 Apps hub (#15)

The suite landing page (#15, #45). The Apps button on every screen opens it.
- **Status chip:** latest run, manifest CID and refresh time ("Run 3 · bafybeih…q7n3 · refreshed 2026-10-17 11:43 UTC"), linking to Runs. States: loading (skeleton) and unavailable ("Run status unavailable" with Try again).
- **Watch demo** and **Pull requests** buttons (links added at submission).
- **App cards:** CountyLens (Open CountyLens, What can I ask?) and Roofing CRM. Until Task B is deployed, the CRM card shows "Coming soon" and a disabled "Not deployed yet" button, so there is no dead link. The CRM card states its first-release scope: **Explore and Search on the map, with three search modes: Map, Filters and AI**; leads, visits and notes come later. "Preview Explore with the map · prototype only" opens `ExploreQ-crmmap`; it is **prototype only, do not ship**, and shows only with the CRM-preview switch on (#87).
- What both apps share, and the legal links.

### 4.1 Explore (home)

One workspace. Query with **Filters, SQL or AI**; **Builder** is a working prototype marked coming soon. Results are a **List** (a paged table at 1440 and 768, paged cards at 390). CountyLens has no view switcher; the List / Map switch exists only in the CRM preview. Property details open on demand.

> **Map view is not Task A scope (#74).** The prototype keeps the full map (markers, ring and handle, count chip, legend, Layers, hexagons, map controls, map keyboard, OSM credits) as a **Roofing CRM preview** behind the ProtoBar switch “Map view (CRM preview) · prototype only, not in CountyLens”, off by default. With it on, Explore shows a dashed note “CRM preview: not part of CountyLens”. Build none of it for CountyLens: no map code, no toggle, no feature flag. The deviations from Atlas are logged in §8.

#### 4.1.1 Layout (List view, as CountyLens ships)

| | 1440 | 768 | 390 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Query panel | Left, x 80, w 320, full height. Collapses to a 256 px summary with Edit query / Save / Clear. | 320 px overlay with a scrim, opened from the query chip in the results bar. | Modal bottom sheet (half → full, drag handle), opened by the **Edit query** extended FAB in the thumb zone. The mode switcher sits in its title row. |
| Results bar (y 64, h 56) | Area picker · Sort (no view switcher); the radius control sits in the table footer, bottom right | Query chip · Area · Sort (icon only) | Replaced by a **sticky results header**: count “within r mi” and Sort; Area chip + radius slider and number field; active filter chips (each opens the query) |
| Results | x 400 (336 when the query panel is collapsed) to the right edge: **paged table**. AI mode: **Answer (480 px)** beside a **numbered Matches table**. | Full width: a 5-column table (Address with lat, lon as a second line · Roof · Conf. · Distance · details); AI mode: Answer above (440), numbered Matches table below (464). Paging stays. | Results are the page: **paged cards** below the sticky header (y 234 to the bottom nav); AI mode adds the Answer tab and numbers the cards. |
| Details | Drawer from the right, 440 px | Drawer 440 px | Full sheet |

The map layouts (map + 360 px cards panel at 1440, map above cards at 768, full-bleed map with a bottom sheet at 390) exist only in the CRM preview.

#### 4.1.2 Shared by all modes

- **Area and radius, outside the query panel (#75, E-34; PO round 5):** they sit where the map view has them, in both views and both switch states; the query panel has no Area or radius.
  - **Area** picker in the results bar (next to Sort), with search ("City, ZIP or address"). Typing filters the list with the match in bold, Enter picks the first match, no match shows a hint. Places can also be set from the top search ("Set as Area"). The centre's lat, lon shows in its tooltip and in the AI "How I read this" line.
  - **Radius:** slider 0.5–10 mi (steps of 0.5) plus a number field; arrow keys step 0.5. **Map view** (CRM preview): the radius card at the bottom right of the map, synced with the ring handle. **List view:** the same control at the bottom right of the results, in the table footer beside the pager. **390 with the map off:** Area chip and radius slider in the sticky results header. In AI mode it edits the radius chip.
- **Results header (#75, E-35):** "128 within 5 mi of Pflugerville city hall · roof ≥ 15 yrs", updated **150 ms after the last change** (count, radius, Area and the active conditions of the current mode).
- **Proof of the radius:** the Mi column with a bearing ("2.4 mi NE"), Sort = Nearest, and Close matches that say how far outside they are ("0.2 mi outside"). Each row has **Open in OpenStreetMap** (an external link with the parcel's lat, lon; not a map in CountyLens).
- **Footer:** match count · Clear · Save (saved searches appear in the search box).
- **SQL binding:** `:area_centre` and `:radius_mi` come from the Area and radius. **AI binding:** a radius stated in the question wins; otherwise the chip reads "Within the Area radius (not stated)".

#### 4.1.3 Query modes

- **Filters:** roof age at least, in years (10 / 13 / 15 / 20 / 25), roofing permit (Any / Open or stalled / Stalled) plus an **"Open ≥ N yrs"** chip with a menu (any time, 1, 3, 5, 10 yrs) that matches the agent's "many years" chip (#59, E-33), owner (Tenure > 10 yrs, Out-of-area).
  - **Definitions inline (#31, #37):** "Out-of-area = mailing address outside Travis County"; "Stalled = open and past its expiry date" (from status, issue and expiry dates; no inspection dates assumed, confirm in A-01); "Tenure = years since the last sale; unknown when there is no sale date".
  - **Suggested queries:** "Out-of-area owners, roof ≥ 20" and "Owners for 10+ years, roof ≥ 15".
- **Builder: prototype, coming soon (#21, #46).** No "Soon" pill on the rail item (PO, round 5); the corner badge stays on the mobile switcher segment (E-30) and the panel note says it is coming soon. It still opens, with the note "Prototype of the coming query builder. Filters, SQL and AI ship first."
  - A plain-language sentence (up to 3 lines) and an All (AND) / Any (OR) switch.
  - Each condition is one compact line: field · operator · value · delete.
  - Fields: Roof age, Permit status, Permit open yrs, Owner tenure, Owner mailing. A field can be used only once, so there are at most 5 conditions.
  - Ships after Filters, SQL and AI (build order step 4).
- **SQL:** an editor with Run and **Schema**, which opens the Data catalog (`/data/catalog`) in a new browser tab (no pop-up), and the bound-parameter line below it.
  - **Suggestions sit below the editor:** Roof ≥ 15 in Area · Open permits 5+ yrs (two at 1440 and 768, so the panel never scrolls; Out-of-area, roof ≥ 20 is the third at 390).
  - **Checks, in order, on Run:**
    1. Empty.
    2. A write keyword: "Read-only".
    3. A misspelled keyword (`SELEC`, `FORM`, `WHER`, `ORDR`, `JION`, …): "Syntax error, line n. 'FORM' is not a keyword. Did you mean FROM?", with a one-click **Replace** button.
    4. Does not start with SELECT or WITH.
    5. Missing FROM.
    6. Unknown view: "There is no view named properties", with a **Use v_property** button that guesses the nearest view.
    7. Unbalanced brackets or quotes.
  - Every error also shows **an example that runs**, the nearest suggestion, with **Use this example**.
  - A successful run shows "n rows · 62 ms · in the list".
  - **Engine line (#27, #64):** "DuckDB-WASM in your browser · read-only · bafybeih…q7n3 (CID copy) · 18.4 MB" (MB from the views the query reads); the tooltip explains the CID-named copy, the check at release and the ipfs.io fallback.
  - **Run it yourself (#27):** toggles a copyable DuckDB CLI command built from the query that ran: `INSTALL httpfs`, one `CREATE VIEW … read_parquet('https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>/<view>.parquet')` per view used, a `dist_mi` macro, and the query with `:area_centre` and `:radius_mi` filled in. It hides the suggestions while open.
- **AI:** a question box (72 px) with **Find** and the session quota "n of 10 AI questions left this session"; the results tab bar repeats it as "n of 10 left", so the quota stays visible while the answer is open (#58, #66, #79). Kept in `sessionStorage`; only answered questions count (not failed, paused or throttled ones, and not chip edits). At the limit Find is disabled and an info banner says "You've used this session's 10 AI questions. Filters and SQL have no limit —" with the button **Open this question in Filters** (same Area, radius and conditions), then plain text, not a button: "More AI questions with sign-in: coming soon." When the daily budget is used up, a paused banner replaces it (E-31; boards `ExploreQ-ailimit`, `ExploreQ-aipaused`). Two suggestions show until a conversation has turns (and on mobile until a question has run).
  - **"Read as" assumption chips are editable (#4):** tap a chip to open a small menu of values. Radius: 1 / 3 / 5 / 7 / 10 mi. Roof age: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 yrs. Years open ("many years" = N): 1 / 3 / 5 / 10. Place: the first five places. Edited chips say "(you set)". ✕ drops a chip as the secondary action.
  - **Answer tab (#24),** the default results tab in AI mode:
    - The question, with a "Follow-up · area from your last question" pill when it applies.
    - **How I read this (#39):** one line built from the assumptions, for example "Pflugerville city hall → 30.4394, −97.6200 · within 5 mi · roof age > 15 yrs (reroof permit, else new build, else year built) · data: v_property · Run 3". Clamped to 2 lines below desktop, full text on hover.
    - Four tool steps streamed one by one (skipped under reduced motion), for example "Found Pflugerville at 30.4394, −97.6200" · "Searched r = 5 mi, roof > 15 yrs" · "Read 9 matching parcels from v_property" · "Checked roof-age basis and confidence". On 768 and 390 the finished steps fold into one "4 steps done · show" row.
    - A summary with numbered citations (5 on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile). **Citations ↔ rows (#76, E-39):** citation [n] matches row n in the numbered Matches table (numbered cards at 390); tapping it highlights row n and opens its Why view, and the row number opens the same Why view. (With the CRM preview on, the numbers also match numbered map pins.)
    - The missing-data note ("BBB: Blocked · 403 on 2026-10-17 · where available").
    - **Conversation:** up to 4 turns, kept on the client. "Earlier in this conversation" shows recent turns with **New conversation**. "That area", "same area" and "near there" reuse the previous area and radius.
  - Recognises distance, places (Pflugerville, Manor, Wells Branch, Austin, the four ZIPs), roof age, permits, contractors and owners.

#### 4.1.4 Map view: CRM preview only, not Task A (#22, #74, #78)

Kept in the prototype for the Roofing CRM; **do not build it in CountyLens.**

**CRM first release (PO, round 5):** Explore and Search with three search modes, **Map, Filters and AI**. With the ProtoBar switch on, the prototype shows exactly that: the query rail has Filters and AI only (SQL and Builder are hidden and a URL asking for them opens Filters), the search box offers Map · Filters · AI as its "Start a new query with" modes and drops SQL suggestions, and the dashed note reads "CRM preview · Map, Filters and AI · not part of CountyLens". The top bar title reads **Roofing CRM**, and the navigation drops **Runs, Coverage and Data** (and the run badge), which belong to CountyLens. In CountyLens (switch off) the search box modes are Filters · SQL · AI, with no Map. The rest of the CRM comes later.

With the switch on, Explore shows the map exactly as in round 4:
- Roof-age markers coloured `--viz-roof-age-*`; stalled permits as a diamond with a dashed outline; non-matching markers dimmed and disabled.
- Radius ring and pin at the Area centre, with the drag handle (E-16) and a count chip ("128 in 5 mi"); the map radius card and Layers popover (E-5).
- Legend (hidden on mobile); zoom in, zoom out, recentre; hexagons and the coverage-gap layer (Soon).
- Keyboard: the map is a tab stop; arrow keys pan, + and − zoom, Home recentres (A-4).
- Selected list rows and AI citations show as numbered pins.

With the switch off (CountyLens) all of these are hidden, along with the OSM credits and licence row, the privacy page's tile-provider sentence and the `tiles/` row in Data · Manifest and Data 390. The CountyLens replacements are the Area + radius block, the results header, the roof-age colour on the Roof cell (E-37) and citations ↔ rows.

#### 4.1.5 Result cards

- **Collapsed:** title · distance with bearing · details (i) · expand. Below it, two **signal chips**: roof yrs (with its roof-age colour swatch) + confidence pill, and permit status. Each chip opens the Why view (#6).
- **Expanded:** adds the basis and contractor line ("BBB not available") and the **Why is this a match?** button.
- **Why view:** replaces the list inside the panel, with Back to results.
  - Each rule with its value; **Coordinates** (lat, lon); a **source record** link; then source · run · CID (#23).
  - Verify CID and Details buttons.
- **Close matches:** their own tab (in the table header at 1440 and 768). Each says what it misses ("0.2 mi outside", "Roof 13 yrs, 2 short"); tapping one relaxes that condition and adds the property, with a "Close match added" pill.
- **Sort:** Oldest roof, Permit open longest, Nearest.

#### 4.1.6 Paging, never scrolling

- Pages are packed to fit the panel's height. In the prototype: collapsed card 88 px, expanded 188 px (170 on tablet), header 48 px, pager 48 px.
- Expanding cards pushes the overflow onto the next page.
- Pager text: "1–7 of 9 sample cards"; the table footer reads "Showing 1–9 of 9 sample rows · Oldest roof" with a compact Pager and Download.
- Changing the query, sort, Area or radius goes back to page 1.

#### 4.1.7 Other Explore pieces

- **List view (the CountyLens results view):** at 1440 a paged table with row checkboxes and the columns # · Address · Roof (colour swatch + number) · Basis · Conf. · Permit · Mi (with bearing) · **Lat, lon** · **Source** (link to the TCAD record) · Open in OpenStreetMap (#23); rows per page from the height (48 px rows); a Pager and Download in the footer. At 768 the 5-column table (56 px rows). In AI mode a numbered table (# · Address with lat, lon · Roof · Conf. · Distance).
- **Details:** opens from (i). "Ask about it" opens AI mode with a question about that address filled in.
- **Opened from search:** each search mode opens Explore in that mode with its query loaded (`ExploreQ-*` boards).
  - Filters: roof15, permits5 (the D-9 board: roof ≥ 15, open or stalled permits open ≥ 5 yrs, near Pflugerville, sorted by longest open), ooa78753 (SC-5: out-of-area owners **and tenure > 10 yrs**, #83), stalled78753.
  - SQL: sqlperm, sql.
  - AI: aicontractor (the D-11 board, drawn as the second turn: D-10's question in "Earlier in this conversation", then "…near that area…" with the follow-up pill and the carried-over area), aiooa, ai, ailimit, aipaused.
  - CRM preview: crmmap (roof15 with Map view on; prototype only).
  - Builder: builder (the prototype, marked Soon).
- **States** (`ExploreStates`, `SqlStates`, `HelperStates`): loading, empty with close matches, error, partial (BBB), rate-limited, and AI "can't answer" (no sale prices).

### 4.2 Search box (every screen)

- **Idle:** a hint box ("Search an address, place, ZIP or permit, or ask a question"), mode chips (Filters, SQL, AI), the suggestion "Open or stalled roofing permits near Pflugerville" (opens Filters), and one de-duplicated list of Suggested, Recent and Saved searches, each with its mode icon. Recent and saved items can be removed.
- **Typing:** matches grouped by **Place, Address and Permit** only. Owner and contractor name search is removed (#33). Footer links: Ask AI / SQL. Place rows show **Set as Area**.
- Has a single clear button; the browser's own clear (✕) is hidden.
- **Modes per app:** CountyLens offers **Filters · SQL · AI** (no Map); the Roofing CRM offers **Map · Filters · AI** (no SQL, and no SQL suggestions or SQL footer link).
- **No scrolling, Close always visible (PO, round 5):** Close sits in a fixed footer outside the list. At 1440 and 768 the suggested, recent and saved list is two columns; at 390 it shows 4 with "Show n more". The panel is 640 px high at most (624 at 390).

### 4.3 Property detail (shared component)

- **Opens as a drawer over the List view** (`Property1440`): the results list stays behind it with the open property highlighted. The map backdrop and the “Show on map” action exist only in the CRM preview; CountyLens shows “Show in the list” (#80).
- **Sections:**
  - **Street View: coming soon** (#17), shown as the no-imagery card; no Google key or billing.
  - Owner and sale (confidential owners show as "withheld").
  - Roof: estimate, basis, confidence and an evidence chain.
  - Permits with contractor and BBB status.
  - **Owner merged from 2 records** (#3, #34, #62): a real de-duplication, two TCAD owner accounts for the same owner (“SAMPLE, JORDAN A”, kept, last sale 2011-07-18, which matches the Owner section; and “JORDAN A SAMPLE”, merged, “same normalised name and mailing address; newer account”), matched on normalised name + mailing address. It links to Coverage → Reconciliation.
  - Provenance (field · source · captured · run · CID · licence).
  - **Similar properties:** a vertical list in the result-card style.
- **Below 600 px**, permits and provenance rows become key–value cards. Nothing scrolls sideways (#10).
- **"Ask about this property":** opens Explore in AI mode.
- **Sizes:** a 560 px drawer at 1440 and 768, a full sheet at 390.

### 4.4 Runs

- **Run picker (the first control on the page):** a dropdown under the title, "Run 3 · latest · 2026-10-17 · 10:22–11:51 UTC · 1 h 29 m · Completed". The menu lists every run newest first, each with its date, start–end time in UTC, duration, status pill and manifest CID, plus a search field (run number or date; Enter picks the first match; Esc closes). It scales to any number of runs (the list scrolls). The picked run drives the pipeline diagram, timeline, latest events and "What Run n changed"; the sync card, the top run badge and the state banner always show the latest run, and an earlier run shows "Viewing an earlier run · Show the latest run". A running or failed run is listed with its status and opens with "Its changes show once it publishes". `?run=<n>` belongs in the URL.
- **Sync card:**
  - Status pill and last and next sync.
  - **County coverage: "99.4% of roll · 410,402 of 412,860 parcels"** (#28).
  - **Public view:** "Admins start runs from the pipeline" with an **Admin sign-in** link and no action buttons.
  - **Admin view** (`RunsAdmin1440`): Start run / Stop run / Retry Comptroller / Retry now / Retry publish / Start first run, depending on state (#19).
  - **Command states (#42, #56):** "“Start run” queued · command cmd-xxxx · waiting for the pipeline host; it expires after 15 min" with Cancel → "Acknowledged (cmd-xxxx)" → the run state changes; if nothing acknowledges in 60 s, "Host offline · the command expires 15 min after it was sent; start the host, or run it from the pipeline CLI". Cancel sends a cancel message for that command ID. The prototype has an Online / Offline switch for the host.
- **Pipeline diagram:**
  - **8 sources:** Austin permits, TCAD properties, TCAD owners and sales, BBB (blocked), Coordinates, TX Comptroller businesses, Overture places, Contractors. They feed four steps: Check and join → Derive → Publish → Verify.
  - Each shows a status icon + label, progress, count and duration. Click for start, end, records, a note and a log link.
- **Timeline (Gantt):** one bar per source and step from 10:20 to 11:55 UTC, with a hover tooltip, a "now" line while running, and **Show as table**.
- **Latest events** change with the state.
- **What Run n changed** (replaces the dated line and slider, which did not scale to many runs):
  - Counted against the run before it; the picker chooses the run.
  - A change-mix bar (added / changed / removed, each marked +, ~ or −).
  - Per-source change bars, manifest and previous CID with copy and Verify, and a Compare link.
- **States:**
  - completed;
  - running (simulated run);
  - partial (Comptroller failed, Run 3 records carried over);
  - stale (9 days);
  - rate-limited;
  - failed;
  - no runs.

  The dashed state bar is **prototype only**. The simulated Running state and the Run 4 sample stay in the prototype as is (#29); the build shows Running only for a real run.
- **Compare (D-7):**
  - The two runs side by side, IPNS now and before, per-source deltas and artifact CID changes.
  - Immutability checks and a directory CAR download.
  - The **prior-CID pill** has three states: Checking ipfs.io and dweb.link… · Prior CID resolves on ipfs.io and dweb.link · Prior CID failed on {gateway}. It stays static in the prototype (#25).
- **History log:** 41 events, filters by event type and run with **Clear filters**, numbered pager (12 per page), Download CSV.

### 4.5 Coverage

- **Summary tiles:**
  - Record kinds complete: 3 of 7 rows (complete / partial / blocked).
  - Records loaded: 3,685,340 of 3,724,754 (98.9%).
  - Areas with permit data: 1 of 4.
  - Counted from: Run 3 · Oct 17.
- **Loaded vs each source's own total:** one row per README record kind, BBB as a sub-row under Contractor (#28):
  1. Property (TCAD appraisal roll).
  2. Permit (Austin `3syk-w9eu`).
  3. Ownership (TCAD owners and sales).
  4. Contractor (names on Austin permits), with the sub-row **Contractor · BBB: "Blocked · 403 on 2026-10-17 · where available"**, linked to its evidence.
  5. Business (TX Comptroller franchise-tax `9cir-efmm`; places from Overture).
  6. Coordinates (TCAD parcel geometry).

  Each row shows status, source, **"Out of: {denominator source}"**, a loaded/missing bar (missing hatched), %, reason, a Run 1–3 trend, collected time and a provenance link. There is a table view.
- **Coverage by area:** the 7 rows × Austin / Pflugerville / Manor / unincorporated on `--viz-seq-1…5`; "No source" and "Blocked" hatched.
- **Reconciliation · duplicates merged in Run 3 (#3):** Property, Owner, Contractor and Business, each with records in, merged, entities out, a share-merged bar (0–20% scale) and the method:
  - Property: TCAD prop ID + geo ID.
  - Owner: normalised name + mailing address.
  - Contractor: licence number, then normalised name + phone.
  - Business: Comptroller taxpayer number; an Overture place within 50 m.

  Owner reads 404,980 in → 398,114 out, the same figure as the Ownership row and MCP `get_coverage` (#34). Worked examples: **owner** 2 accounts → 1 (opens Property detail) and **contractor** “SAMPLE ROOFING CO”, “Sample Roofing Company LLC” and “Sample Rfg Co” → Sample Roofing Co. (one licence, 11 permits). Counts come from the run's `coverage.json`; merge counts and examples from its `merge_stats.json` (#62).
- **Cost (#7, #40, #55),** full width, 15 resources in two columns, each with what it is for and its idle cost. Header pill: "$0.51 a month when idle".
  - Web app (AWS Amplify Hosting) · S3 bucket (`runs/live.json`, CID-named copies) · API Gateway + Lambda (tRPC and the MCP endpoint) · model API calls · IPNS publisher · SSM Parameter Store (IPNS key, config) · Cognito user pool · SES · SQS run-command queue · CloudWatch Logs · Route 53 hosted zone + ACM ($0.50 a month) · Filebase pinning (free tier, 5 GB) · GitHub Releases (CAR copies) · public gateways (ipfs.io, dweb.link; run by Interplanetary Shipyard, not ours) · pipeline (local Restate stack).
  - Last bill **$0.62** (Sample), explained on the card: $0.50 Route 53 hosted zone + $0.12 usage while testing (model calls and Lambda requests), from Cost Explorer captured 10-01. A $5/month budget alert, and a link to the evidence in the run release.
- Known limitations · source speed and constraints (TX Comptroller and Overture rows).
- **States:** loaded, loading, gaps only, rate-limited (cached counts), error, empty.

### 4.6 Data

- **Manifest (D-5):**
  - IPNS card and manifest card.
  - Artifacts table (name, CID with copy, codec, size, SHA-256, Verify): 13 rows on 2 pages. (The `tiles/` row shows only in the CRM preview; CountyLens publishes no map tiles, #78.)
  - Download `manifest.json`.
- **Verify (D-6, #26):**
  - Pick an artifact. Files under 50 MB race on two lanes, **Lane A · ipfs.io** and **Lane B · dweb.link**, each with its operator (Interplanetary Shipyard) (#69), showing bytes, time, status and the **exact URL fetched**: the plain file URL of a `bafybei…` root (`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeigr7…`, `https://bafybeigr7….ipfs.dweb.link/`), never `?format=raw` (#35). Filebase stores the files and its gateway is never a lane. `DataStates` and `Data390` use the same 38.2 MB example; larger files and directories show Verify via CAR (#53).
  - Directories and large files show **Verify via CAR** with the reason.
  - Results: Verified, Mismatch, Rate-limited with a countdown. Reduced motion shows "Received n%" (A-8).
- **Catalog:**
  - Frozen tables (properties, permits, owners, contractors) plus supporting ones (roof_age, businesses).
  - Field types, meanings, sources and licences.
  - Query in SQL.

### 4.7 Activity (admin only, #18, #19, #43)

- **Header note:** "Server-side events from CloudWatch Logs: AI questions, MCP calls, Try a tool and search · kept 30 days · no personal data. Browser queries (Filters, SQL, Builder) run on the visitor's device and are not logged."
- **BBB never shows as a failure (#60):** an AI question about BBB ratings is logged as "Answered · BBB missing-data note". No sample row searches a contractor name (#33).
- **Last week:** server events, median and p95 response, failure rate, top areas, top questions and tools, failure reasons.
- **Query log:**
  - Type chips (AI, MCP, Try a tool, Search) and Failed only, with **Clear filters**.
  - Numbered pager (8 rows per page); Download CSV; Run again.
  - Below 600 px each row stacks as a key–value card.

### 4.8 Help · MCP and API docs (#2)

- **Endpoint:** `https://countylens.aldarraj.com/mcp`, its own stateless Streamable HTTP handler sharing `query-core`, with CORS and Origin checks. **Access:** public and read-only for `tools/list` and `tools/call`, no token, throttled (stage rate limit and reserved concurrency); throttled calls return `429` (#44, #57).
- **Tools, each with input schema, a copy-paste example and its real response:**
  - `search_properties`
  - `get_property`
  - `list_permits`
  - `get_coverage`
  - `list_runs`
  - `resolve_place`
- **Connect a client (#57):** Claude Desktop via `mcp-remote` (`{"mcpServers": {"countylens": {"command": "npx", "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://countylens.aldarraj.com/mcp"]}}}`), Claude Code (`claude mcp add --transport http countylens https://countylens.aldarraj.com/mcp`) and MCP Inspector (Streamable HTTP, no header).
- **Try a tool:** pick a tool, edit the JSON arguments, Run, and see the response and timing. It calls the same public endpoint. The prototype shows a labelled sample response; the build must show the live reply.

### 4.9 Sign-in: admins now, AI users coming soon (#19, #41, #42, #58, #66)

One email-code screen with two roles (E-32). **Admin** (`AdminSignIn*`), opened from **Admin** at the end of the main navigation: a banner says **"The demo needs no admin access. Every demo step runs on the public pages."**; only allow-listed addresses get a code, no self sign-up; done → Go to Runs. **AI user** (`UserSignIn*`) is **coming soon**: the boards show the planned flow with a "Coming soon" banner and nothing links to them yet. Both use Cognito's built-in 6-digit email code.
- **States:** email entry (with validation) → sending → code entry ("works once, for 5 minutes") → wrong code ("n tries left") → expired code (Send a new code) → too many attempts (try again in 15 minutes) → signed in (Go to Runs). The prototype has a state bar.
- Once signed in, the Admin pill shows, and admin actions and Activity appear.

### 4.10 First visit: "What can I ask?" (#47)

The welcome screen and the 5-step tour are cut. On a first visit, Explore opens with one dismissible card over the results (E-28):
- One line on what the data is, then three example questions; tapping one runs it in AI mode.
- Close (✕) or **Got it** dismisses it; **What can I ask?** in the Help menu (and the apps hub) reopens it.
- Placed over the results: x = results left + 16 at 1440, x 96 at 768, full width at 390.

Similar properties in Property detail stays (redesigned in round 1).

## 5. User flows (board `Flows`)

- **A · First visit, under 2 minutes:** “What can I ask?” card → tap a question or search an area → filter by roof age → open a property → signal chip → Why view → ask in AI mode.
- **B · Evaluator demo:** D-1 to D-12 in order (§9), for an 8–10 minute video. Plan a fresh run just before recording, so the badge shows a recent date (#13).
- **C · No dead ends:** no results → close matches, each saying what it misses → widen the radius or add permits → AI mode with the question carried over → back to the same list.
- **D · AI mode → citations ↔ rows:** ask → answer with steps and numbered citations that match numbered rows → change a chip → results re-run → follow-up "near that area" → open a cited property.
- **E · Prove any value:** signal chip → Why view (coordinates, source link) → manifest row → gateway race → honest result.

| E-31 | Session quota counter (10 per session) and limit banner with Open this question in Filters (#58, #66, #79) |
| E-32 | Sign-in role variant: admin and AI user (#58) |
| E-33 | "Open ≥ N yrs" chip menu in Filters (#59) |
| E-34 | Area picker in the results bar; radius control at the bottom right of the results (map card in map view, table footer in list view, sticky header at 390) (#75) |
| E-35 | Live results header and radius proof: bearing, Nearest, "0.2 mi outside", OpenStreetMap link (#75) |
| E-36 | List-first layouts at 1440, 768 and 390; 390 sticky header, Edit query FAB and query bottom sheet (#74, #77) |
| E-37 | Roof-age colour on the Roof cell, always with the number (#74) |
| E-38 | ~~Disabled "Map · Soon" segment~~ removed (PO, round 5): CountyLens has no view switcher; `view=map` falls back to List (#74) |
| E-39 | Citation ↔ numbered row (#76) |
| E-40 | Run picker: dropdown with every run and its timestamp, first control on Runs (PO, round 5) |

**Deviations when mapView is OFF** (CountyLens ships with it off; each one has its full version with mapView ON, in the CRM):

| Atlas rule | Atlas expects | CountyLens | Full version |
|---|---|---|---|
| §14.1 rule 3 | Full-bleed map + bottom sheet at 390 | List-first page of paged cards, sticky header, Edit query FAB opening a bottom sheet | Full version available with mapView ON (CRM) |
| §14.2 #1 | Live radius ring | Radius slider and number field at the bottom right of the results + live results header | Full version available with mapView ON (CRM) |
| §14.2 #2 | Roof-age heat | Roof-age colour on the Roof cell, always with the number | Full version available with mapView ON (CRM) |
| §14.2 #5 | Agent → map pins | Citations ↔ numbered rows | Full version available with mapView ON (CRM) |

**Tokens (#12):** every corner radius uses `--md-sys-shape-corner-*`. The off-scale 2, 3 and 6 px radii became extra-small (4 px). The literal `#747775` became `--md-sys-color-outline`.

## 9. Demo script mapping (D-1 to D-12)

| Demo | What it shows | Screen | Board and state | How to show it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Opening context: Travis County, TX · Run 3 · {date} | App shell | `Explore1440`; `ShellStates` | Point at the location chip and run badge; the badge opens Runs |
| D-2 | Run summary: sources, counts, timestamps, limitations, % of roll | Runs | `Runs1440` · Completed | 8 sources with BBB blocked; County coverage 99.4% of roll; click Austin permits |
| D-3 | Records by source with collection time and provenance | Coverage | `Coverage1440` · Loaded | Six record-kind rows with denominators, then the area grid, Reconciliation and Cost |
| D-4 | Query layer: DuckDB in the browser, no hosted database; reads the CID-named copy first, public gateway fallback | Explore · SQL | `ExploreQ-sql`, `ExploreQ-sqlperm`; `SqlStates` | Run a suggestion; read the engine line; open Run it yourself and copy the DuckDB command; type FORM to show the fix |
| D-5 | Artifact manifest: CID, size, codec, digest; IPNS → CID | Data · Manifest | `DataManifest1440` | IPNS card, then the artifacts table |
| D-6 | Two-gateway fetch; bytes match size and digest | Data · Verify | `DataVerify1440`; `DataStates` | Pick the 38.2 MB file; press Verify; read the plain file URLs on ipfs.io and dweb.link and each lane's operator; show a directory → Verify via CAR |
| D-7 | New CID, old one intact; IPNS moves; CAR | Runs · Compare | `RunsCompare1440` | Prior CID resolves on both gateways; IPNS before and after; CAR |
| D-8 | Radius, roof ≥ 15: count, basis, coordinates, source | Explore · Filters (List view, map switch off) | `ExploreQ-roof15` | Move the radius slider or type in the number field; the header updates ("128 within 5 mi of Pflugerville city hall · roof ≥ 15 yrs"); Sort = Nearest; Mi with bearing, lat, lon, Source and Open in OpenStreetMap per row; a Close match "0.2 mi outside"; a row → Why view |
| D-9 | Open roof permits in the D-8 area: duration, contractor, BBB or a labelled gap | Explore · Filters + Property | `ExploreQ-permits5` (roof ≥ 15, open or stalled, open ≥ 5 yrs, near Pflugerville), `Property1440` | Same area and roof rule as D-8; the Open ≥ 5 yrs chip; permit chips on cards; the stalled definition; "BBB: Blocked · 403 on 2026-10-17 · where available"; Owner merged from 2 records |
| D-10 | Old roofs within 5 mi of Pflugerville, with reasoning and evidence | Explore · AI (List view, map switch off) | `ExploreQ-ai` | Tap the first suggestion, Find; read How I read this; steps stream; **citations ↔ rows**: tap [2] → row 2 highlights in the numbered Matches table and its Why view opens |
| D-11 | Long-open permits **near that area**, contractor, assumptions, gaps | Explore · AI | `ExploreQ-aicontractor` (two turns) | D-10's question sits in "Earlier in this conversation"; the follow-up "…near that area…" shows the follow-up pill and reuses Pflugerville; change "Open ≥ 5 yrs" to 3; BBB note |
| D-12 | MCP-ready: tool list and one answered query | Help · MCP | `HelpMcp1440` | Public, read-only, throttled endpoint (no token); tools and schemas; Try a tool `search_properties`; connect from Claude Desktop (mcp-remote), Claude Code or Inspector |

## 10. Accessibility (board `A11yAudit`)

- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 in light and dark; chart colours validated in both themes. (Map shapes ≥ 3:1 belongs to the CRM preview.)
- **Touch targets: 48 px is the build rule** (Atlas §14.1); smeargle checks it on every screen.
- A visible focus ring everywhere, inset where a container clips it.
- The radius works by keyboard (slider and number field, arrow keys); every chart has a table view or text alternative. (Map keyboard, A-4, belongs to the CRM preview.)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` gives a reduced version of each animation (A-8 gateway race; A-6, A-7 in the CRM preview); the answer steps appear at once.
- Status is never shown by colour alone: always an icon plus a label (and +, ~, − on change charts).
- Live regions announce counts, the results header, SQL messages, answer text and page changes.

## 11. Open items

1. **#29 Running state and Run 4 sample** stay in the prototype as is. The build cuts them and shows Running only for a real run.
2. **#30 Area sample places** are demo data. The build needs the places gazetteer (§2).
3. **#32 Data contract outputs** (§2) are covered in implementation stories A-02 and A-11.
4. **#13 Badge wording** is final as "Run 3 · {date}"; exact copy is settled in implementation.
5. **Mobile property sheet** scrolls (a full-page sheet; accepted).
6. **Settings** is not drawn.
7. **#38 Demo city:** count real roofing permits in the Pflugerville 5 mi ring during A-02; switch the demo centre if D-11 comes back thin (§2).
8. **#37 Stalled definition:** confirm in A-01 whether the Austin data has inspection dates; until then stalled = open and past its expiry date.
9. **#51 Hexagons and map layers:** CRM preview only; no CountyLens marker; not Task A (decisions #22, #74, #82). A deliberate deviation from Brief A, built in the Roofing CRM.
10. **#52 Compare:** at implementation, link "Directory CAR, Run 3" to `carCid` and its GitHub Release copy, and show each run's data window (`updated_at` from → to) (decision #25).
11. **G3 architecture gate:** #54/#69 lane B is dweb.link (same operator as ipfs.io; confirm CORS, Range and the subdomain redirect in the A-02 spike), #58 AI spend caps (budget, steps, tokens, concurrency), #64 CID-named copies with gateway fallback. All three are applied in the design and §2; record them in the constitution at G3.
12. **#63 Similar properties** stays (PO decision); its similarity rule is still to be defined in implementation (a proposal: same ZIP, roof age within 3 yrs).
13. **#65 Hub links:** wire "Watch demo" and "Pull requests" at release.
14. **#69 Gateway spike** in A-02 (§2 Verify): ipfs.io + dweb.link on one real Filebase-pinned CID.
15. **#70 Privacy:** the page now describes admin accounts (email only, Cognito eu-north-1, deleted within 30 days of a request or of access ending) and says no user IDs, emails or IPs reach the activity log; needs legal review before launch.
16. **Map view: CRM task.** Not designed for CountyLens (no view switcher); the map, its layers and its keyboard model are the Roofing CRM's (Task B). The prototype keeps them behind the ProtoBar switch (#74, #78).

## 12. Suggested build order

1. `query-core` and the data contract: views, manifest, `runs.json`, `coverage.json`, `merge_stats.json`, `cost.json`, gazetteer, fixtures.
2. App shell, URL state, SearchBox, admin gate (Cognito email code, SQS run-command queue).
3. Explore: Filters + Area picker (results bar) + radius control (results footer) + live results header + paged List (table at 1440 and 768, cards at 390 with the sticky header and Edit query sheet) + Why view, close matches + property drawer. Explore ships List view only (no view switcher).
4. SQL (DuckDB-WASM, checks, suggestions); AI mode on the server agent (editable chips, answer panel, follow-ups); then Builder.
5. Runs, Compare, Log · Coverage (rows, reconciliation, cost) · Data manifest and Verify · Catalog.
6. Help · MCP page on the public, throttled `/mcp`; apps hub with its status chip.
7. States for every screen; 768 and 390 rules; accessibility pass against §10. (No map work: the map is the CRM's.)
8. Activity (server-side events in CloudWatch Logs) and the "What can I ask?" card (nice to have).

**Acceptance check:**
- Every row in §9 can be demonstrated end to end with the map switch off.
- Explore ships List view only, with no view switcher, and `view=map` falls back to List.
- No map code, map toggle or feature flag ships; no `tiles/` in the manifest.
- No panel scrolls at 390, 768 or 1440 in Explore.
- Every value has a source → run → CID path.
- Sample values are labelled.
- Coming-soon items carry a "Soon" pill; only Builder has a working prototype, and it is not in the first release.
