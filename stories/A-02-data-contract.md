## Context

The UI, the agent, the MCP server and the Roofing CRM (Task B) must all read the same data model, or "MCP-ready without changing the data model" (D-12) cannot be true. The **CRM developer** needs exact column names and meanings plus real rows to build against on day 2, before the full county lands. Names come from the lexicon (`mew` owns them, AD-07); classification rules live in versioned profiles, never in the views (ARD § 5).

**The first risk to settle (mew R1/R2, both high, open since 2026-10-19).** Only `elephant-cli` output is public (A2), so a field is publishable only if the lexicon has a class or property for it (AD-25). Mew could not confirm carriers for the **printed contractor name**, **`status_raw`**, **`expiry_date`**, **BBB** or the per-permit contractor state, and the live lexicon tools were still failing on 2026-10-19. If these carriers are missing, demo lines D-9 and D-11 cannot show "who is the listed contractor" or "source says Expired" from published data. This story settles it first, before any name is frozen.

Real classification facts (Austin `3syk-w9eu`, live query 2026-10-19): **22,084** rows have `REROOF`, `RE-ROOF` or `ROOF REPLACE` in the description, while `work_class = 'Roof'` matches only 52; searching `ROOF` alone pulls in about 10k `Auxiliary Power` (rooftop solar) permits. Status split of the 22,084: Final 17,251 · VOID 2,400 · Expired 2,213 · Active 125 · Withdrawn 87 · Cancelled 4 · Suspended 2 · Re Review 1 · Pending Permit 1.

## Description

As a **Roofing CRM developer**, I want **four frozen DuckDB views with exact lexicon names, a versioned roofing and status profile, a shared place gazetteer, and 20 real sample rows**, so that **I can build the CRM against a contract that will not change under me**.

When done:
- **Lexicon carrier record** `docs/decisions/0002-lexicon-carriers.md`: for each needed field, the lexicon class and property that carries it (from the live schema and a real `tables-export.json`), or "no carrier" with the filed extension request and the UI fallback.
- `packages/query-core/views.sql` defines `v_property`, `v_roofing_permit`, `v_contractor` and `v_run` over the `elephant-cli export-tables` output, with mew's AD-07 names frozen against that `tables-export.json`.
- `packages/contract` holds the Zod schemas (`RunManifestV1`, `RunsIndexV1`, `Provenance`, view rows).
- The Travis/Austin profile (`profiles/travis-austin@semver`) holds the reroof include/exclude list and the status map.
- **Place gazetteer** `packages/query-core/gazetteer/travis-places@semver`: every Census place and ZIP (ZCTA) in Travis County with its internal point, built from the public US Census 2024 Gazetteer files, with source URL, file date and SHA-256 stamped on every lookup (AD-26 pattern: versioned code in git, not an IPFS artifact). The UI area search (A-13), the agent's `geocodePlace` (A-14) and the MCP `area` argument (A-15) all use it.
- `contract/v1/README.md` and `contract/v1/sample.parquet` (20 real rows) committed for Task B.

**Overrides applied (ARD § 15, AD-30):** the PO runs `/soofi-xyz-team-kit:use-neutral-lexicon` during this story because mew cannot start it (mew R4); the 20 sample rows are **cut from the elephant-cli tables of the pilot run**, committed in git only, never published as a separate IPFS artifact and never shown on the hosted site (A2, P0-12).

**Independent test:** `docs/decisions/0002-lexicon-carriers.md` has a verdict for every field; `pnpm vitest packages/query-core` passes over the pilot tables; `duckdb -c "SELECT count(*) FROM 'contract/v1/sample.parquet'"` returns 20.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1** (lexicon carrier check) · **Given** the PO has run `use-neutral-lexicon` and a pilot run has produced a real `tables-export.json`, **When** mew and oracle check each needed field — printed contractor name, `status_raw`, `expiry_date`, BBB rating and profile URL, per-permit contractor state (`candidate` / `ambiguous` / `conflicting`), `roof_age_basis`, `roof_age_confidence`, owner sale date — **Then** `0002-lexicon-carriers.md` records for each one either the exact class.property that carries it **and** a pilot row where it appears in the export, or "no carrier" with the lexicon extension request filed and the fallback named (AD-24: `resolved`/`unresolved` plus five-state totals; AD-25: field not published and the UI shows the reason). No field is frozen into a view before it has a verdict. ☐ testable
2. **AC-2** · **Given** the carrier verdicts and the real `tables-export.json`, **When** `views.sql` is bound to it, **Then** all four views compile in DuckDB and expose exactly the AD-07 names for every field that has a carrier, including `roof_age_years`, `roof_age_basis` ∈ {`permit`, `new_construction`, `built_year`, `unknown`}, `tenure_years` + `tenure_basis`, `owner_is_out_of_area` + `owner_area_class`, `coordinate_source`, `issue_date`, `final_date`, `open_days`, `contractor_company_cid` and `bbb_status` ∈ {`rated`, `not_found`, `blocked`, `not_checked`}. ☐ testable
3. **AC-3** · **Given** the profile `travis-austin@{version}` with include terms REROOF, RE-ROOF, ROOF REPLACE and excludes for solar/PV, Auxiliary Power, RTU, roof deck and "roof-mounted", **When** a random sample of 25 classified Austin permits is reviewed, **Then** at least 24 of 25 are correct, at most 5% land in `needs_review`, and 0 solar/PV/RTU permits are accepted as roofing. ☐ testable
4. **AC-4** · **Given** the status map (AD-08), **When** the 22,084 reroof candidates are classified, **Then** Active, Pending, Pending Permit, On Hold, Suspended, Inactive Pending Revision and Re Review are `open`; Expired and Expired - License are `stalled`; Final and Closed are `closed`; VOID, Withdrawn, Cancelled\*, Aborted, Denied but Closed, Revoked and Rejected are `exclude`; and where `status_raw` has a carrier it keeps the source word (an Expired permit is never relabelled Completed or Cancelled). ☐ testable
5. **AC-5** (scale) · **Given** the profile applied to the full Austin dataset (2,380,725 rows on 2026-10-19), **When** the roofing classification runs, **Then** the reroof candidate count is within the profile's recorded expectation (22,084 description matches on 2026-10-19, minus excludes), the ~10k Auxiliary Power rows are all excluded, and the profile's SHA-256 is stamped on every classification (AD-26). ☐ testable
6. **AC-6** · **Given** the place gazetteer, **When** "Pflugerville", "Manor", "Lakeway" or ZIP "78753" is looked up, **Then** it returns the Census internal point (for example Pflugerville city, GEOID 4857176, 30.447765, −97.602116) with the source file URL, file date and SHA-256; **Given** "ZIP 99999" or a place outside Travis County, **Then** it returns `out_of_scope`, never a guessed point. ☐ testable
7. **AC-7** (missing data) · **Given** a field whose AC-1 verdict is "no carrier", or a property with no deed date, **When** the view row is read, **Then** the row shows the reason instead of a blank (for example `bbb_status = not_checked` with reason `no_lexicon_carrier`, contractor "not published · no lexicon carrier", `tenure_basis = unknown`, never "long tenure"). ☐ testable
8. **AC-8** · **Given** the 20 sample rows, **When** Task B reads `contract/v1/sample.parquet`, **Then** every row has non-null provenance (`source_url`, `captured_at`, `table`, `table_cid`, `run_id`, `manifest_cid`), the rows include at least one stalled reroof and one property with roof age, and the README documents every column and every "no carrier" gap. ☐ testable

## Edge cases (at least two)

- The live lexicon tools are still down when the check runs → the check waits or uses the schema bundled with the installed `elephant-cli` and a real pilot export; it never freezes names from memory.
- A carrier exists but `export-tables` does not emit it as a column → treated as "no carrier" for the views until the export includes it.
- A status word not in the map appears (new Austin vocabulary) → `needs_review`, never guessed; the profile version is bumped when it is mapped.
- A Census place straddles the county line (Round Rock, Cedar Park, Leander) → kept with a `partial_in_travis` flag; results are still limited to Travis County.

## Requirements

| REQ | Requirement | Traces to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-001 | System MUST record a carrier verdict for every needed field before freezing names | AC-1 |
| FR-002 | System MUST define the four views over elephant-cli tables only, with AD-07 names | AC-2 |
| FR-003 | System MUST keep roofing and status classification in a versioned profile, not in SQL (no `LIKE '%ROOF%'` in views; CI grep gate) | AC-3, AC-4, AC-5 |
| FR-004 | System MUST provide one versioned place gazetteer from public Census data, used by UI, agent and MCP | AC-6 |
| FR-005 | System MUST show a missing reason for every field without a value or carrier | AC-7 |
| FR-006 | System MUST commit 20 real rows cut from pilot elephant-cli tables, git only | AC-8 |
| NFR-001 | Classifier accuracy ≥ 24/25 per profile version, ≤ 5% `needs_review`, 0 solar/PV/RTU accepted | AC-3 |
| NFR-002 | ≥ 80% unit-test coverage on `query-core` and `contract` (NFR-09) | AC-2, AC-6 |

## Prototype reference

Not a UI story. The column names appear on the SQL board (`design/prototype/ExploreQ-sql.dc.html`), the area search on `design/prototype/SearchBox.dc.html`, and the MCP schemas on `design/prototype/HelpMcp1440.dc.html`.

## Demo Script

1. Presenter: "Now I am opening the DuckDB-backed query layer." → Expected: the SQL panel (A-13) queries these views by their frozen names.
2. Presenter: "Finally, I will show that the system is MCP-ready." → Expected: the MCP tools (A-15) return the same view columns.

## Out of scope

- Publishing the sample rows or the gazetteer to IPFS, or showing sample rows on the hosted site (ARD § 15).
- Full-county data (A-04 to A-10).

## Evidence to capture

- `docs/evidence/A-02.md`: the carrier verdict table, extension requests filed, `tables-export.json` digest, the frozen column list, the 25-permit classifier review, gazetteer source and digest.
- `testplans/A-02-test-cases.md` results, `docs/reviews/CR-A02.md`.
