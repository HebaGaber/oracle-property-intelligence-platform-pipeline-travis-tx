# A-16 Prove zero idle cost and let the operator run the pipeline from the hosted app

**Merged story (2026-10-21).** This story now holds two former stories so the six-stage loop runs once: **A-16** (zero idle cost and source limits, Must) and **A-17** (admin sign-in and run commands, Should). The original files are in [stories/merged/](merged/) for history; this file is the one to plan, build and gate. Every AC keeps its old ID in brackets, for example `(A-17 AC-2)`, so older evidence and reviews still trace.

## Context

**Part 1, cost and limits (was A-16, Must).** The README asks to "demonstrate that Oracle can operate without carrying the infrastructure cost" (AC-20, AC-44) and to identify and document slow or constrained sources (AC-17 to AC-19). The **evaluator** wants a real billing number, not a claim; the **Oracle operator** needs the measured limits to plan refreshes.

Measured constraints so far: TCAD `publicinformation` HTTP 403 (2026-10-17, 2026-10-19); Travis GIS timed out (same days) and pages at 2,000 features per request; Austin Socrata 2,380,725 rows, ≤ 50,000 rows per page, and a full `:updated_at` re-stamp on 2026-10-19; BBB Cloudflare challenge (2026-10-17), ≤ 1 request per 3 s; Bedrock 10 requests per minute (2026-10-17).

**Part 2, admin sign-in and run commands (was A-17, Should).** Architecture decision AD-12 (Accepted 2026-10-19) puts admin pieces in the product and builds them **last**: Cognito email-code sign-in, an SQS command queue, and a local bridge next to the pipeline. The **Oracle operator** gets a way to trigger the incremental refresh (part of A-11) on demand from the hosted app without exposing the laptop or the Query DB. The bridge **pulls** commands outbound, so nothing in AWS can reach the operator machine (ARD § 2.2). The public demo never needs this; every demo step works signed out.

The two parts share infrastructure and cost rules: Part 2's Cognito, SQS, DLQ and SNS must stay inside Part 1's $0-idle rule, and Part 1's CDK assertions cover both.

## Description

As the **evaluator**, I want **to see on the hosted Coverage page what CountyLens costs while idle, who pays for each part, and how fast each source can be read**, so that **I can confirm Oracle carries no standing infrastructure cost and that source limits are known and respected**.

As the **Oracle operator**, I want **to sign in with my email and password and start, stop or retry an incremental run from the Runs page, and see recent activity**, so that **I can refresh Travis County data on demand while the Query DB stays private on my machine**.

When done:
- **Part 1:** `docs/cost.md` (component, idle cost, cost per use, who pays) with real numbers from Cost Explorer and Filebase, plus a Budgets/Cost Explorer screenshot; `docs/source-limits.md` (throughput, rate limits, anti-bot posture, slow sites, BBB limits) from the A-01 to A-11 measurements; both shown on the Coverage page's Cost and Limits sections. CDK assertions enforce the cost rules.
- **Part 2:** A Cognito user pool with email + password sign-in (copied from Task B, PO 2026-10-26), self sign-up off, and an `admin` group. An `adminProcedure` that verifies the JWT with `aws-jwt-verify`. `admin.runs.start / stop / retry` send a command to an SQS queue (15-minute expiry, cancel by command ID) with a DLQ and one alarm that emails the operator through SNS. A local bridge in `pipeline/` polls the queue outbound and starts the Restate `CountyIngest` workflow. It writes `runs/live.json`, a small admin S3 status object. The Activity page shows `admin.activity.summary / list` from the query log through Logs Insights, cached 5 minutes. Admin controls appear only after sign-in.

**Independent test:** (1) open Coverage · Cost on the hosted URL; it shows "$0.00 fixed per month" with the billing date, and `cdk synth` assertions pass. (2) Sign in as the admin on the hosted URL, press Start for an Austin-permits window, see the command reach the bridge and the run state change in `runs/live.json`; sign in as a non-admin and get 403.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Part 1 · Zero idle cost and source limits (was A-16, Must)

1. **AC-1** (A-16 AC-1, window amended 2026-10-26 by the PO) · **Given** the deployed stacks, **When** Cost Explorer is read for the last full billed days (at least 3), grouped by service and by record type, with per-use lines (evaluator traffic, CI, deploys) separated from idle lines, **Then** `docs/cost.md` shows each component's idle cost (Amplify static, Lambda, API Gateway, S3 + CloudFront CID copy, DynamoDB on-demand, SSM, CloudWatch Logs, disabled scheduler, Cognito, SQS + DLQ, SNS) with $0.00 fixed per month plus storage cents, who pays per use, and the screenshot is in `docs/evidence/img/`. ☐ testable
2. **AC-2** (A-16 AC-2) · **Given** the CDK app, **When** `cdk synth` runs, **Then** assertions confirm: scheduler `DISABLED`; no Secrets Manager, RDS, KMS CMK, provisioned concurrency, WAF or Route 53 hosted zone; log retention 14 days (query log 30); a $10 budget alert; region from config. ☐ testable
3. **AC-3** (A-16 AC-3, scale) · **Given** the measurements from A-01 to A-11, **When** `docs/source-limits.md` is written, **Then** every source has throughput (rows or requests per minute), page size, the full-capture duration measured at full scale (for example the 2,380,725-row Austin backfill and the full GIS paging), rate limits, anti-bot posture and the optimisation applied. ☐ testable
4. **AC-4** (A-16 AC-4) · **Given** the hosted Coverage page, **When** the evaluator opens Cost and Limits, **Then** both sections render the same numbers as the two docs, each with its "as of" date and source. ☐ testable
5. **AC-5** (A-16 AC-5, missing data) · **Given** Cost Explorer has not yet produced data for the current day (about 24 h lag) or Filebase usage is not readable through its API, **When** the page renders, **Then** it shows the last available date with "as of {date}" or "Filebase usage: not available · {reason}", never a zero filled in. ☐ testable

### Part 2 · Admin sign-in and run commands (was A-17, Should)

6. **AC-6** (A-17 AC-1, amended 2026-10-26: sign-in copied from Task B's working Cognito email + password flow instead of the email code, PO decision) · **Given** the operator's email is in the `admin` group, **When** they open Admin and sign in with that email and its password, **Then** they land on Runs with Start / Stop / Retry visible and "Signed in as admin" shown; signed-out visitors never see these controls. ☐ testable
7. **AC-7** (A-17 AC-2) · **Given** a signed-in admin and the bridge running, **When** they press Start for "Austin permits since Run {n} watermark", **Then** one SQS message with a command ID is sent, the bridge picks it up within 60 s, the Restate `CountyIngest` workflow starts, and the Runs page shows "Running · started {UTC time}" from `runs/live.json`. ☐ testable
8. **AC-8** (A-17 AC-3, error) · **Given** a signed-in user who is not in the `admin` group, or an expired token, **When** they call any `admin.*` procedure, **Then** the API answers 403 or 401, sends nothing to SQS, and logs the refusal without the token. ☐ testable
9. **AC-9** (A-17 AC-4, missing data / error) · **Given** the bridge is offline, **When** a Start command waits 15 minutes, **Then** it expires, the UI shows "Bridge offline · command expired at {time}", nothing runs later by surprise, and after 3 failed receives the message goes to the DLQ, whose alarm emails the operator. ☐ testable
10. **AC-10** (A-17 AC-5, scale) · **Given** 30 days of query log, **When** the admin opens Activity, **Then** the summary (questions per day, p95 latency, failures by outcome) loads in p95 < 3 s through the 5-minute cache, and every number links to its Logs Insights query. ☐ testable
11. **AC-11** (A-17 AC-6) · **Given** the CDK app, **When** `cdk synth` runs, **Then** assertions confirm self sign-up off, the queue's DLQ and alarm, no inbound path from AWS to the operator machine, no Query DB connection string in `apps/` or `infra/`, and $0 idle cost (Cognito free tier, SQS per request). ☐ testable

### Part 3 · Close the carried gaps and match the prototype (added 2026-10-26, PO)

12. **AC-12** (prototype, scale) · **Given** the hosted app and the CountyLens boards in `design/prototype/`, **When** each page is opened at 390, 768 and 1440 px in every state its board shows (light theme), **Then** its layout, section order, components, labels and states match its board, and every remaining difference is listed in `docs/evidence/A-16-prototype-parity.md` with its reason (an AD-xx decision, real data, or an accessibility rule); placeholder numbers on the boards are not compared. ☐ testable
13. **AC-13** (full county, scale) · **Given** the latest published full-county run (441,961 properties), **When** an evaluator runs an Explore search (radius, roof age, open permits, tenure, out-of-area owner), asks the agent a README prompt, or calls an MCP data tool, **Then** each answers from a per-run Explore index built only from that run's published CIDs (recorded in the index), with p95 < 3 s for Explore and no Lambda timeout, and the A-13/A-14 tests parked for this gap run again. ☐ testable
14. **AC-14** (missing data / closure) · **Given** the items carried forward from A-11, A-13 and A-14 below, **When** A-16 reaches G7, **Then** each row of the Closure table is closed with evidence or listed in `docs/evidence/A-16.md` § Exceptions with its reason and a PO decision; no parked test is counted as passed. ☐ testable

## Edge cases (at least two)

- (A-16) AWS free-plan credits show a credit offset → show both gross cost and credits applied, so "$0" is not just credits.
- (A-16) A Lambda invocation during the sampled day (evaluator traffic) → shown as per-use cost, not idle cost.
- (A-16) A source that never became reachable (TCAD 403) → its limit row says "blocked" with dates, not a throughput.
- (A-17) Two Start presses in a row → the second is rejected while a run is active ("A run is already running"); one command ID per run.
- (A-17) Stop during publication → the bridge finishes the current atomic step, never leaves half-published CIDs, and records "stopped by admin" in the run limitations.
- (A-17) Cognito refuses the sign-in (too many attempts, or its service limit is reached) → the sign-in screen shows "Sign-in is not available right now, try later"; the public app is unaffected.
- (cost window, PO 2026-10-26) The story must finish in one 3-hour session, so AC-1 reads the last full billed days, splits idle from per-use by service and record type, and states the Part 2 resources (Cognito, SQS, SNS) from their pricing model until their first billed day; recorded as a gate exception.
- (merge) The Part 2 resources (Cognito, SQS, DLQ, SNS) appear in Cost Explorer → they are listed in `docs/cost.md` as per-use, with $0 idle; a non-zero idle line fails AC-1.

## Demo Script

1. Presenter: "Now I am opening the DuckDB-backed query layer." → Expected: alongside the SQL panel, Coverage · Cost shows that no Oracle-hosted database or standing infrastructure is billed.
2. (Optional closing aside, not on the README transcript) "As the Oracle operator I can also start the next incremental run from here; the command is pulled by my machine, so the database never leaves it." → Expected: Start, then "Running" on Runs.

## Carried forward from A-11 (known gaps to close here)

A-11 (Run 1, full publish) merged with seven recorded, deliberate gaps — tracked in `specs/011-publish-and-runs/run-log.md` — that this story's "operator starts a run" scope (Part 2, was A-17) is the right place to close, rather than reopening A-11:

1. **Sequence-runner batching isn't automated.** Run 1's county/permits batching (10 + 2 CARs) was done with separate scripts, not wired into the pipeline's own orchestrator. **AC-7's bridge-starts-the-workflow path needs this wired in before "Start" can run a real full-scale incremental refresh** — this is foundational to Part 2, not an add-on. **The wired batch publish must go through `pipeline/publish/src/bind-guard.ts` and the identity gate (`src/identity-gate.ts`, the `gate` and `gate-remote` steps of `scripts/publish-run.ts`); publishing outside a gated path is not allowed.** Run 1 was published by side scripts that bypassed both and shipped with 0 of 17,387 permits joining their county property.
2. **Runs 2 and 3 are still pending** (need UTC dates ≥ 2026-10-25 and ≥ 2026-10-26). Once gap 1 is fixed, **the natural way to produce them is the admin "Start" button itself** (AC-7) on the right UTC dates, rather than a manual script run — this story's own acceptance test effectively re-proves Runs 2/3 as a side effect.
3. **No genuine second independent pin.** Pinata's free plan can't pin-by-CID (paid-only, confirmed 2026-10-24), and its upload fallback assigns an unrelated CID. The Pinata account was upgraded to a paid plan same-day, but `pinByHash` still returned `403 PAID_FEATURE_ONLY` after the upgrade and a retry — either propagation delay or a tier mismatch, unconfirmed; needs checking directly in Pinata's dashboard. Fallback real fix if that doesn't resolve: a self-hosted Kubo node kept online. Revisit alongside Part 1's cost accounting (AC-1), since either option has a real cost line that belongs in `docs/cost.md`.
4. **Run 1's full gateway verification (`ALL ARTIFACTS VERIFIED`) was not complete at A-11's merge** — blocked by sustained Pinata rate-limiting from testing volume, not a data problem. Continuing on `011-publish-and-runs` after merge; confirm it's reached `ALL ARTIFACTS VERIFIED` before this story's own G7, since Part 2's run-history UI depends on Run 1 being provably real.
5. **Atlas registration pending** (no Atlas access in this environment) — an external dependency, not work of ours: it never blocks this story, A-11's closure or any run (neither README requires it; `PUBLISHING.md`). Stays documented as the known P0-4 default and carried forward honestly.
6. **Manifest reconciliation gap** (porygon's A-11 review, non-blocking there): `buildManifest()`'s coverage section doesn't yet sum the 5 permit-exclusion keys against captured-vs-emitted totals. Harmless at A-11's scope (3 of 5 are provably zero), but **must be fixed before AC-7's real incremental runs rely on it**, since those will exercise the full-scale permit path where the gap is live.
7. **~~Client-side CID verification can't handle real table parts~~ — closed in A-11 (2026-10-24).** PO decision "SHA-256 from manifest": table parts are now accepted only when their SHA-256 equals the one the CID-verified manifest records (constitution A3 amended); the Permits page prefetches its 14-part subset (Run 1: 1,234 requests / 76.7 s → 15 / ~8 s), and TC-032/033/034 are no longer `fixme`. Left here: a manifest above 256 KiB would still hit `rawCid()`'s single-chunk limit (Run 2's is 87 KB); a full UnixFS CID check stays optional.
8. **Publish/resume hardening left from the A-11 reviews** (`docs/reviews/CR-A-11-machamp-fix.md`, 80/100; `CR-A-11-porygon-fix.md`, 80/100): a test and run evidence for `batch-hash-validate-export.sh`'s `.done`/`split.done` resume (M4); run locks for the re-export and batch scripts; removing stray folders from a hashed group directory; deriving the re-export fingerprint's code list from real imports instead of a hand list; a Runs-page cue that Run 1 is superseded by Run 2 (17,387 → 15,025 is a correction, not lost permits); a code check for `permits_trade_sub_permit`. (M1–M3 — index rollback on failed verification, atomic receipt/index writes, CAR hash check before a Release upload — were fixed in A-11.) Also: record a receipt once a file is confirmed on the gateways, so later publishes do not re-probe it (Run 2's carCid step spent ~25 min re-confirming Run 1's 20 county carCids).
9. **Fallback memory limit — PO decision 2026-10-24: show a message.** When the Filebase fallback would prefetch a run larger than the browser can hold (the full county run is ~3 GB), the page must show an explicit "too large for the fallback path" state instead of loading it all (today the fallback prefetches without a ceiling; `apps/web/src/engine/load-permits.ts`).
10. **`/code-review medium` findings carried from A-11** (`docs/reviews/CR-A-11.md`): (a) `pipeline/publish/src/gateway-readback.ts:136` `gatewaysAgree` treats Pinata's 403/429 bot challenges as inconclusive, so "both gateways" can pass on Filebase alone — needs a PO policy call; (b) stale-lock takeover is check-then-delete (`pipeline/local-stack/scripts/run-lock.ts:39`, `batch-hash-validate-export.sh`) — make it atomic; (c) the permits path always passes the assembled coordinate while the County writer does so only once coordinates are assembled (`pipeline/oracle-runtime/travis/permits/write-group.ts:133`) — mirror the County flag before any run on an unassembled database; (d) coverage keys are carried unchanged when the permit count is unchanged (`run-manifest.ts:187`); (e) the Permits page waits for the DuckDB module before prefetching parts (`load-permits.ts:158`), ~1 s against the 8 s target.
11. **Permits page first-load time at full-county scale (moved from A-11, PO 2026-10-24: "Revise target, optimize later").** Run 2 on the hosted site: 15,025 rows, no error, COUNT 0.26 s, list 0.56 s, but first load 24–28 s from a home connection and ~45 s from GitHub runners (~95 MB: DuckDB engine start 6–10 s + all columns of the 10 `county.property` parts the join needs). TC-NF-01's limit was revised 8 s → 60 s for full scale (`tests/e2e/lib/perf.ts`). Optimize here: fetch only the columns the join needs (`county.property.cid`) instead of whole parts, cut engine start, then restore a tighter limit. The full manifest verification (every artifact from both gateways, hours at full-county size) is an operator tool; hosted CI runs a very small sample (PO 2026-10-25). Also find why hosted CI was cancelled ~2 min into the Permits cases with 2 or 4 Playwright workers on a 16 GB runner (1 worker completes): check a Permits tab's peak memory at full scale, then raise the parallel phase's workers again. **Update 2026-10-25 (root cause found):** the full-county Permits page built about 947,000 DOM elements (15,025 rows, about 390 MB), which froze slow CI browsers after the "Listing permits" stage; the worker cancellations (2 or 4 parallel workers) are probably the same cause (memory). A-11 now pages the list (200 rows per page). Here: measure first load after paging, then tighten the 60 s limit; and re-test 2 and 4 parallel workers per shard now that the page is light.
12. **Responsive test A-03-TC-NF-03 at full-county scale (moved from A-11, PO 2026-10-24: "skip the responsive test and delegate to a16").** The test's Atlas token audit (`tests/e2e/lib/atlas-tokens.ts` `atlasTokenAudit`, `smallTapTargets`) reads the computed style of every element on the page; at full scale the Permits page holds ~15,000 rows, three widths over, so it runs for many minutes. It is `test.fixme` in `tests/e2e/responsive.spec.ts`. Fix: audit the page chrome plus the first 50 repeated rows/cards (they share styles), e.g. skip elements inside `tbody > tr:nth-child(n+51)` / `ul > li:nth-child(n+51)`; then remove the fixme and run `smeargle` on the Permits and Runs pages. **Update 2026-10-25:** the paging change (200 rows per page) removes the cause of the slow audit, so the `test.fixme` is removed in A-11; what stays here is running `smeargle` on the Permits and Runs pages.
13. **Runs → Permits in the same tab on Linux Chrome (from A-11, PO 2026-10-25) — closed 2026-10-25, root cause found.** The stall was not the tab or Linux Chrome: the full-county Permits page built about 947,000 DOM elements (15,025 rows, about 390 MB) and froze slow browsers after the "Listing permits" stage; a fresh browser context stalled the same way on CI. A-11 pages the list (200 rows per page) and TC-012 step 4 is back to same-tab navigation. Nothing left to do here.
14. **Second independent pin and an independent public gateway (from the A-11 README review, PO 2026-10-25: keep for story 16).** The README's example gateways (ipfs.io, dweb.link) now answer 429 or a service-worker page, so they cannot show byte-matching fetches. Pinata is the only gateway independent of us: it served both manifests with matching bytes but rate-limits table parts and CARs (429), and the PO's Pinata key is seen as free plan. Filebase matches every object but is our own pinning vendor. Do: get a key from the paid Pinata workspace (or another provider the PO approves), pin the CARs, re-run the gateway check from `docs/reviews/run3-coverage-task-a.md` section 4, attach the 10 county CARs to the newest GitHub Release (Run 2's Release holds only the 5 permit CARs), and record which gateways were proven for which objects. Until then the demo shows one independent gateway for CARs and parts. Run 3 (PO 2026-10-25): the car-files step ran with Filebase-only readback (`PUBLISH_DEFER_PINATA=1`, commit d8040e6) because Pinata served the new county CARs at about 59 KB/s, beyond the 300 s whole-file readback; re-verify all Run 3 carCid files on Pinata (or the paid second pin) here.
15. **Run 3 publishes the data fixes (from A-11 close, PO 2026-10-25).** A-11 was closed without Run 3. ERR-68 (roof date), ERR-69 (owner names) and ERR-70 (open_days for finished permits) are fixed in code and tested, but the published Run 2 still has the old data. Run 3 must re-write the County group, publish a manifest linking to Run 2 on a later UTC date, and then run the immutability check (items 2 and 4). Status 2026-10-25 (Run 3 session): Run 3 was built with all three fixes and is being published (manifest `bafkreifndsdibdllvgpzwmif6getzwvc6rupk5tgeak4eypccaw3t7vlfm`, already pinned on Filebase and served by Filebase and Pinata); this item closes when the `index` step and the merge of branch `011c-run3-integrated` land.
16. **`/code-review medium` findings on the Run 3 corrections (A-11 close, PO 2026-10-25).** Findings 1–7 and 10 in `docs/reviews/CR-A-11.md` § 4: owner-name precedence (entity word before structured name), roof_date read from a mutable table, `address_zip` partial coverage, the per-person fallback counter, the trailing-"&" co-owner count, the identity gate's previous-run binding and untimed downloads, `verify-manifest --sample` exit code, and the `openDaysReason` default. Resolve before Run 3 publishes. Run 3 was built and published with these findings open (PO 2026-10-25). The two marked "fix before Run 3" did not change Run 3's result: the roof-age ledger was current when the County group was written (P3 check) and the previous-run identity gate passed without hanging. They remain risks for later runs: make roof_date reproducible from published inputs, and give the previous-run bind a timeout.

17. **Reviewer-agent findings on the Run 3 corrections (A-11 Run 3, 2026-10-25).** `docs/reviews/CR-A-11.md` section 5, R2 to R11 (oracle 76, donphan 78, machamp 78, porygon 72 before R1 was fixed). Run 3 is already published, so the data findings (R2, R3, R8, R9) change only from Run 4: printed-name contractor as an ADR lexicon gap, the exact TCAD request kept for deed rows, manifest coverage keys for the new fields and a first-run flag per new source, a city check on address-point matches. Publish tooling (R4 to R6): `deferredGateways` in car-file receipts, an atomic lock and a receipt re-check after taking it, real exit codes in the worker scripts. Docs and labels (R10, R11): the Run 2 tenure figure (175,408 or 175,406), the `bbb_blocked` wording ("BBB blocks automated lookups; not checked for this contractor"), v_contractor notes for v1.1, retry scope and `OWNER_PERSONS` in the manifest. After the merge with A-14 (2026-10-25): the agent still treats contractor questions as not answerable (`asksContractorOrBbb` in `apps/api/src/agent/ask.ts`); since contract v1.1 the printed contractor name is published, so the answer should use it with its "as printed, unverified" label.

## Carried forward from A-13 (known gaps to close here)

A-13 (Explorer UI and content pages) was closed on 2026-10-25 with the gaps below, by PO decision "go to option 3 and document the gaps in A-16" (record: `docs/decisions/DEC-A-13-explore-full-county.md`). Every one of them was measured on the hosted site against the real Run 2 (441,961 properties, 15,025 permits); none was hidden or faked.

1. **Explore search does not run on the full county (the main gap).** One `explore.search` call joins `v_property` and `v_roofing_permit` over the whole county inside the API Lambda. It first ran out of memory (DuckDB limit 1 GB, raised to 2 GB), then exceeded the Lambda timeout (15 s, raised to 29 s, the HTTP API limit): every call still returns HTTP 500 after about 29 s, warm or cold. On the earlier 14-property slice it answered in 817 ms. Parked (skipped with this reason in the report, `parkGap` in `tests/e2e/lib/a13-fixtures.ts`): A-13-TC-008, 009, 025–027, 029–037, 041, 043, 062, 065, 073, 074, 086, and so the demo lines D-8 and D-9 on live data. Delete the `parkGap` calls when this closes. Until then the page shows the search error after one attempt (about 29 s): the Explore query no longer retries automatically (the client default retried once, which doubled the wait to about 59 s), and the page keeps its own Retry button. **To close it:** a per-run Explore index, one row per property with location, roof age, tenure, out-of-area owner and nearest open-permit age, built from the published tables only and searched instead of the whole-county join. Two ways: (a) a private derived file in the CID-copy bucket, built from the laptop, about 5–7 h plus 2–3 hosted CI cycles; (b) a published artifact in a new run, about 1.5–2 days. Step 0 is a 1-hour timing measurement (cold file reads versus the query itself). Needs an ADR-0001 amendment, because the read path changes.
2. **SQL panel first query takes about 97 s on the full county (A-13-TC-040 limit 8 s).** On the CI runner it is worse: the page either stays on "Loading the query engine" past 60 s (A-13-TC-040) or shows `Invalid Error: Opening file https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/… failed … NetworkError` (A-13-TC-023: the read fell to the Filebase fallback and was refused). Parked for this item: A-13-TC-004, 023, 028, 038, 039 and 040. The panel now binds every contract view and reads the 225 table parts by range; the first query waits for that. After it, queries are fast. `SELECT count(*) FROM v_property` returns 441,961. **To close it:** bind lazily per view the query names, or read one footer per table instead of one per part.
3. **LCP over the 2,500 ms limit on the manifest-driven pages (A-13-TC-058 and TC-081).** Measured with the Lighthouse mobile profile (150 ms RTT, 1.6 Mbps, 4x CPU, median of 3 loads) on CI run 40183901653: Runs · Log 3,040 ms (3,068 ms in the TC-058 run), Catalog 3,068 ms, Runs 2,800 ms, Coverage 2,700 ms, Data · Manifest 3,392 ms; Data · Manifest also has CLS 0.132 against 0.1. On the 14-property slice these pages measured 2.28–2.41 s. Parked: A-13-TC-058 and TC-081 (so TC-081's INP and the other three pages are not measured while it is parked; unpark it to see them). The run manifest is only 88 KB (27 KB gzipped); the cost is rendering 240 table rows and reading two manifests before the first paint. **To close it:** load only the run list first, and the events on demand.
4. **Run 3 does not exist** (A-11 closed without it). A-13-TC-015 and AC-1 ("Runs 1 to 3", Compare of Run 3 against Run 2) and AC-12 ("at least 3 runs" in the Runs log) can only be shown for Runs 1 and 2. This is items 2 and 4 of the A-11 list above; closing them closes this one.
5. **Run 2 publishes only permit coverage keys.** `coverage` has no parcel or property count (the county tables are reused from Run 1), so the Coverage page lists permit kinds only. The expected property count in A-13-TC-004 is the documented 441,961 (`docs/evidence/A-04.md`). **To close it:** the manifest builder adds the county counts, and the Coverage page shows them (A-11 manifest change, so a new run).
6. **Infrastructure changed under A-13, to carry into the cost review:** API Lambda `CountyLensApi` DuckDB limit 2 GB (was 1 GB) and timeout 29 s (was 15 s); both are deployed from the laptop and recorded in `infra/`. The 29 s timeout is a stop-gap and can go back to 15 s once item 1 is closed. Review risk (metagross, 2026-10-25): at 3,008 MB a failing Explore search bills up to about 87 GB-s (about $0.0012), the stage throttle allows 10 rps, so a polling client could cost about $40 an hour and about 290 concurrent runs would reach the account concurrency quota (the $120 credit budget stops access when spent). Because every search fails at 29 s whatever the timeout, **put the timeout back to 15 s now (one CDK deploy) and add a per-route throttle for `explore.search` plus a Lambda duration alarm**; read `Max Memory Used` from a cold Explore search REPORT line and keep the 2 GB DuckDB cap only if the peak stays under 2.8 GB.
7. **Review follow-ups from the post-merge review (`docs/reviews/CR-A-13.md`, metagross 80, audino 80), all Minor or copy:** a one-line `role="status"` note under the SQL progress bar explaining the long first query; a Retry on the SQL engine-error banner; an "unclassified table parts (N)" row in the Catalog; an accessible name and an inset focus ring for the focusable `<main>`; `scripts/ci-watch.sh` to stop on `timed_out` as well; TC-041 back to 20 timed runs and TC-004's property count derived from the Query DB oracle when they are unparked.
8. **Hosted-test status at A-13 close:** see `docs/reports/A-13-test-report.md` (final CI run and per-case result). The cases that fail only because of items 1 to 4 stay red on purpose; they are the proof of the gap and should turn green when it is closed.

## Carried forward from A-14 (known gaps to close here)

A-14 (agent, AI tab and MCP server) was closed on 2026-10-25 with the gaps below, by PO decisions "Close like A-13" and "yes document it". Every one of them was measured on the hosted site.

1. **Agent, AI tab and MCP data tools do not run on the full county (the main gap, same cause as A-13 item 1).** On Run 1 and Run 2 any call that reads property data ends in the Lambda timeout (agent HTTP 500 at 25 s). Proven only on the small run `travis-202609-permits-20261021t103516z` (pinned `manifest_cid`). Record: `docs/decisions/DEC-A-14-agent-mcp-full-county.md`. Closing it is the per-run Explore index of A-13 item 1; afterwards re-run G1 to G6, the AC-8 three-way comparison and the MCP checks on Run 2.
2. **A burst above 5 rps on `/mcp` mostly answers 503, not 429 (ERR-64).** Record: `docs/decisions/DEC-A-14-mcp-burst-503.md`; test A-14-TC-021 stays red. Options: WAF rate rule, more account Lambda concurrency, or amend the contract.
3. **Account Lambda concurrency is 10 and shared by the query API, the agent and the MCP server.** A failing or bursty caller on one can starve the others (also A-13 item 6). Review together with the stop-gap timeouts and memory (agent and MCP at 3,008 MB under AM-09).
4. **Golden queries G1 to G4 and G6 pass on a run with zero matching rows.** They show honest empty-result behaviour, not retrieval over real rows; G4 and G6 each have one check recorded as inconclusive. Re-run on Run 2 once item 1 is closed.
5. **Several honesty answers rest on deterministic sentences added by the server from the question's wording** (contractor not printed, BBB status not available, owner location not in the export). They are true of this data, but they are a safety net and not model reasoning; re-check them when a run publishes those fields.
6. **Convergence tasks deferred from A-14 (T038-T040, T042-T044, T046, T047, T049, T050 in `specs/014-agent-and-mcp/tasks.md` Phase 6), by PO decision "Focused subset":** a stalled-permit follow-up after an empty open result; a "partly outside Travis" sentence for places like Round Rock; edited assumptions applied deterministically and scoped to one re-ask; a distinct reason for transient run-lookup errors instead of `run_not_found`; wiring the 80% spend alarm to the Ops SNS topic; a more-than-25-row case in the parity tests and the hosted three-way comparison on the full county; pre-loading the MCP token at cold start (TC-028); `resetsAt` on the paused answer; honesty flags derived from tool filters and results instead of English regexes; recording every tool call per step.
7. **Permits with no property row are dropped before any tool sees them (final review, donphan Major 2).** The generated view SQL (`packages/query-core/src/sql.generated.ts`, `meta.permit`) inner-joins `county.property`, so a permit whose property is missing from the published data never reaches `v_roofing_permit`. `list_permits` therefore cannot count them; the `unknown_excluded.property_link` key added in A-14 is defensive and never fires on the real views (only `coordinates`, permits whose property has no latitude or longitude, can). Closing it needs a count against the raw tables or a change to the generated view, then re-publishing the contract; until then the number of permits without a property is unknown to the agent and the MCP server.
8. **Final-review items not built in A-14 (alakazam, ash, oracle, donphan, `docs/reviews/CR-A-14-final-*.md`):** `matches[]`, `missing[]` and `query` accumulate across loosened retries in one answer; the MCP server has no per-call deadline (a full-county call ends at the 15 s Lambda timeout with a bare gateway error); `listPermits` with `permit_number` ignores the area and status filters while `applied` echoes them; the runs index is fetched on every call without a cache; `postCheck` strips property, table and manifest CIDs the model quotes because only row CIDs are registered; the proxy rate limit is per sandbox; no token-rotation TTL.

## Out of scope

- Enabling the scheduler or any paid plan as a default; enabling the EventBridge schedule (stays disabled, AD-15).
- Company PagerDuty and Lexicon metric registration (deviations D-04, D-05).
- AI-user sign-in (Coming soon in A-13, which now includes the former A-18).

## Evidence to capture

- `docs/evidence/A-16.md`, one section per part:
  - Part 1: `docs/cost.md`, `docs/source-limits.md`, billing screenshot, `cdk synth` assertion output.
  - Part 2: sign-in screenshots, the SQS message ID → bridge log → Restate workflow ID chain, 403 check, DLQ alarm test email, CDK assertion output, trace ID.
- `smeargle` report (Coverage and admin screens); `testplans/A-16-test-cases.md` results; `docs/reviews/CR-A-16.md`.
