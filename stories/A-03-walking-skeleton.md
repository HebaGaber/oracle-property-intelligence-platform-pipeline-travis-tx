# A-03 Publish one month of Austin roofing permits by CID and show them in the hosted UI

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Evaluation point | A4 (primary) · A5 |
| Demo line(s) | D-1 (opening: data on IPFS, queryable through DuckDB), D-2 (Runs page), D-4 (DuckDB in the browser) |

| Depends on | A-01, A-02. Already available, no new story dependency: the TCAD 2026 certified JSON export (`tcad-2026-certified-json`, located and measured in A-01) supplies the parcels the slice's permits match. |

## Context

The **evaluator** scores only what runs on the hosted URL, so a thin end-to-end slice must be live before scale is added: source → kit runtime → `elephant-cli` → IPFS → hosted page. It also proves the zero-idle-cost read path before the full county depends on it.

Real slice (Austin `3syk-w9eu`, live query 2026-10-19): **42** permits issued in September 2026 match the reroof description terms (2026 so far: 270). The final count after the A-02 profile runs is whatever the manifest records.

Re-measured 2026-10-20T23:46Z (live query): still **42** September 2026 permits match the reroof description terms; the frozen profile `travis-austin@1.0.0` accepts **38** as reroofs (the other 4 are trade sub-permits, D-4b). Of the 38, **1** has no `tcad_id` and **0** lack `contractor_company_name`. Under the frozen contract (A-02) a permit with no `tcad_id` is not emitted and is counted in the manifest `coverage` as `permits_no_tcad_geoid`, so the published count can be lower than 38.

## Description

As a **CRM developer**, I want **one real month of Austin reroof permits published as CIDv1 artifacts and listed on the hosted CountyLens site through DuckDB-WASM**, so that **I can see the whole path from public source to public CID to query working before the full county lands**.

When done, A-03 has built the Turborepo scaffold (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/*`, `pipeline/*`, `infra/` with the five CDK stacks, AD-23), folded `pipeline-ci.yml` (from A-01) into the Turborepo CI, and extended the vendored kit runtime in `pipeline/oracle-runtime` and its Travis county folder (both from A-01) with a minimal Socrata adapter for September 2026 reroof permits; it adds the exact publication sequence (validate → hash → validate CAR → export-tables → upload with readback), `runs/{runId}/manifest.json`, `runs/index.json`, and a hosted Runs page and Permits list that read the CID through DuckDB-WASM.

**Before Stage 3:** the 4-hour read-path spike (`docs/decisions/0001-read-path.md`) measures p50/p95 for COUNT, radius and roof-age queries through both the S3 + CloudFront CID copy and the Filebase gateway, plain GETs on ipfs.io and dweb.link, the Filebase plan limits, and the projected full-county size, and chooses the `export-tables` part size.

**Overrides applied (ARD § 15, AD-30):** the domain is `countylens.aldarraj.com` through Namecheap CNAMEs (ASM-8, AD-13), not `explorer.{domain}`; reads go through the S3 + CloudFront CID copy with Filebase as the labelled fallback (AD-02), not Filebase range reads; the spike measures both. No IPNS (AD-03).

**Independent test:** open `https://countylens.aldarraj.com/runs` (or the Amplify branch URL), see the run; open the Permits list, see the September 2026 rows; run `npx tsx scripts/verify-manifest.ts runs/{runId}/manifest.json`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1** · **Given** September 2026 Austin reroof permits captured through the kit runtime, **When** the publication sequence runs, **Then** each step runs in order with no step skipped (a test asserts the order), the manifest lists every artifact with a CIDv1 (`bafy…`), name, codec, size and SHA-256, and the tables directory has a `carCid`. ☑ testable
2. **AC-2** · **Given** the hosted site, **When** the evaluator opens Runs, **Then** it shows the run's ID, start and finish time (UTC), every source in the manifest (first "City of Austin Issued Construction Permits (3syk-w9eu)", then the TCAD 2026 certified export, `tcad-2026-certified-json`), the record count from the manifest, and the manifest CID; the run publishes the `county` group (the TCAD parcels the slice's permits match) and the `property_improvement` group, as in the A-02 pilot; Playwright on the hosted URL checks it (demo line D-2), and the page passes at 390, 768 and 1440 px using Atlas tokens only (`smeargle`). ☑ testable
3. **AC-3** · **Given** the Permits list, **When** it loads, **Then** DuckDB-WASM in the browser reads the CID copy and lists every published September 2026 reroof permit with permit number, `improvement_status`, `status_class` (open / stalled / closed), `issue_date`, `contractor_resolution`, and provenance (source URL, capture time, table CID, run); each absent field shows the human label of its reason from the row's `missing` list (for example `no_lexicon_carrier`, `contractor_unresolved`, `enum_lacks_value`), never a blank; the engine line says "DuckDB-WASM in your browser · read-only" and no database server is involved; the page passes at 390, 768 and 1440 px using Atlas tokens only (`smeargle`). ☑ testable
4. **AC-4** (scale) · **Given** the read-path spike's full-size Parquet of the 2,380,725-row Austin permit table, **When** 20 timed runs query it through the CID copy, **Then** COUNT, bounding-box + haversine radius and roof-age filters each have p95 < 3 s and the first DuckDB load is ≤ 8 s with a progress bar; if p95 ≥ 3 s, the decision record switches to the Lambda DuckDB fallback before Stage 3. ☑ testable
5. **AC-5** (missing data / error) · **Given** the published September 2026 permits, **When** they are listed, **Then** every row shows a label for each of its `missing` reasons, never a blank; **Given** a captured permit with no `tcad_id` (1 of the 38 on 2026-10-20; 508 of the 22,084 reroof candidates on 2026-10-19), **When** the run is published, **Then** that permit is not published and the Runs page shows the manifest count `permits_no_tcad_geoid` labelled "No TCAD id on source record"; and **Given** the CID copy is unreachable, **When** the page loads, **Then** it reads through the Filebase gateway and labels the result "fallback". ☑ testable
6. **AC-6** · **Given** `verify-manifest` runs against the run's manifest, **When** it fetches every artifact from ipfs.io and dweb.link, **Then** sizes and SHA-256 match and it prints `ALL ARTIFACTS VERIFIED`. ☑ testable
7. **AC-7** (observability) · **Given** the deployed `CountyLensApi` and `CountyLensOps` stacks, **When** the hosted Runs page calls the API once, **Then** the Lambda writes one JSON log line through Powertools Logger with the request's correlation ID, an X-Ray trace with the DuckDB query as a subsegment, and a `QueryDurationMs` metric; the evidence records the warm API p95 (< 1 s) and the cold start including DuckDB init (< 3 s); log groups keep 14 days (query log 30 days); every queue has a DLQ with one self-resolving CloudWatch alarm that emails the operator through SNS (D-04, PagerDuty substitute); the `$10` AWS Budget alert exists; CDK assertions check all of these, and the trace ID is written into `docs/evidence/A-03.md`. ☑ testable

## Edge cases (at least two)

- Fewer than 42 permits survive the profile (some descriptions are solar or RTU work; on 2026-10-20 the frozen profile accepted 38, the other 4 being trade sub-permits) → the page shows the manifest's count; nothing is padded.
- The Amplify certificate is still pending on `countylens.aldarraj.com` → the Amplify branch URL is the hosted runtime (ASM-8); evidence names which URL was used.
- `aws lambda get-account-settings` shows a total concurrency limit of 10 → no reserved concurrency (AD-11); API throttles only.
- Loading state while DuckDB-WASM initialises → progress bar, no empty table flash.

## Prototype reference (mandatory if the story has UI)

## Demo Script

1. Presenter: "First, I am opening the pipeline run summary." → Expected: the run with source, count, UTC timestamps and manifest CID.
2. Presenter: "Now I am opening the DuckDB-backed query layer." → Expected: permit rows queried in the browser, with the engine line showing no database server.

## Out of scope

- Full-county data, coverage page, verify button (A-04 to A-13).
- Admin sign-in and run controls (built last, AD-12).

## Evidence to capture

- `docs/evidence/A-03.md`: hosted URL, build SHA from `/build.json`, manifest CID, `verify-manifest` output, Playwright trace, spike p95 table, one CloudWatch log line and X-Ray trace ID, CDK assertion output.
- `docs/decisions/0001-read-path.md`.
- `testplans/A-03-test-cases.md` results, `docs/reviews/CR-A-03.md`.
