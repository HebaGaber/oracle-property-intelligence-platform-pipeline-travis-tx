## Decisions and actions still needed from the PO

| When | Item |
| --- | --- |
| ≈ 01:35 | 🛑 OK to deploy infra from the laptop (D1) |
| ≈ 01:40 | ✋ create the two Cognito users + test env file (U1) |
| ≈ 02:15 | ✋ start the local stack and the bridge (BR) |
| ≈ 02:30 | ✋ Cost Explorer screenshot (EV) |
| ≈ 02:40 | 🛑 G7 approval and merge |

## Risks

- Parity work is the largest; families not finished by 02:00 go in as recorded differences.
- Amplify builds can queue 10–25 min; batch 2 must be pushed by about 02:05.
- Second pin (Storacha) moved to a separate PO session (2026-10-26); A11-3/A11-14 recorded as handled there.
- Run 3 publish is another session's GitHub job (started 23:21 EEST); not in this story's path.
