# Contract: `pipeline/docs/travis-sources.yaml`

Internal contract. Input to the kit validator (kit 0.99.1 catalog contract, `use-oracle/reference/readiness-and-completeness.md`) plus A-01 extensions the validator ignores and `check-catalog.ts` enforces. Entity rules are in [data-model.md](../data-model.md).

## Format rules (research R5)

Block style only; no flow maps or lists, anchors or multi-line scalars. Quote FIPS, IDs, dates and any string containing `#` or `:`. No bare `yes`/`no`.

## Shape (abridged; values illustrative of type only)

## Checker rules (`check-catalog.ts`, exit 0 = all pass)

Usage: `check-catalog [path]` (default `pipeline/docs/travis-sources.yaml`). Each failed rule prints one line `FAIL rule <n>: <subject> <detail>` and the command exits 1. Fixed formats used by the G6 test cases:

- rule 3: `FAIL rule 3: <source_key> projected <hours> h has no decision`
- rule 6: `FAIL rule 6: jurisdictions <actual> != census place_count + 1 (<expected>)`

1. All 9 source keys present.
2. Every Measurement has `source_url` and `captured_at`; every null has `missing_reason`.
3. Every source has `decision` and `decision_reason`; required when projected hours > 48.
4. Comptroller has `travis_coded_rows` and `statewide_rows`.
5. Austin has count, null `tcad_id` count, throughput (pages ≥ 3, page size ≤ 50,000), projection and decision.
6. Jurisdiction count = `census_reference.place_count + 1`; no `needs-review`; every `spec_class` maps to its `status` per research R3.
7. Austin-issued counts located in other jurisdictions are present under Austin.
8. GIS is counted, or blocked with `gap_pct: unknown` and a reason.
9. No string contains `postgres://`, a token value or an absolute home path.
