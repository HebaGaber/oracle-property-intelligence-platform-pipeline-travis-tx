// CountyLensOps (A-03 T075): operations with nothing that bills while idle (plan § "Idle-cost
// justification per resource"). One SNS topic with the operator's email subscription (the
// PagerDuty substitute, plan Complexity Tracking D-04; the address comes from OPERATOR_EMAIL
// and is never in git), three self-resolving alarms (Lambda Errors ≥ 1 per 5 min, Throttles ≥ 1,
// HTTP API 5xx ≥ 1; ALARM and OK both notify, missing data is not breaching so each clears
// itself), the $10 monthly budget with 80 % actual and 100 % forecast notifications (NFR-02,
// TC-052) as an AwsCustomResource over the Budgets API (CloudFormation has no
// AWS::Budgets::Budget type in the project region, F3006, and no stack may live in another
// region; a budget is an account-level object, so the call needs no regional resource). The only
// Lambda here is the budget's singleton provider, which runs on deploy only ($0 idle). Alarms
// reference the Api stack's function and HTTP API through cross-stack exports (ARD § 16 AM-02
// order: Api before Ops).
//
// No GitHub OIDC provider and no CI deploy role (ARD § 16 AM-08, 2026-10-21): the AWS
// Organizations SCP denies iam:CreateOpenIDConnectProvider in this account, so CI never deploys;
// every infra deploy runs from the PO's laptop (profile assess) after a PO approval per deploy.
