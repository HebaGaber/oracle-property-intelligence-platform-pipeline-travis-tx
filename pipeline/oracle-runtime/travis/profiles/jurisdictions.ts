// T031: the curated Travis County permit-jurisdiction profile (research R4, AD-26 style).
//
// One entry per incorporated place (Census CLASSFP C*) listed for Travis County in the 2020
// Census place-by-county file, plus Travis County unincorporated. Each entry records the
// class from spec clarification Q1 (FR-004b), the case that maps it to the kit validator
// status (research R3, status-map.ts), the portal, the official evidence page, and a
// complete records request: the lawful route if the portal has no history or the evidence
// page is blocked at the live run.
//
// Research basis: official city, county and Census pages read on 2026-10-19 with single,
// identified requests (no traviscad.org, no bbb.org, no challenge bypass). Anything that
// could not be confirmed on an official page carries a `notes` entry starting
// "unverified:" for the live run (T048) or the operator to resolve. The workflow probes
// every evidence_url again and stamps evidence_captured_at; it never trusts this file's
// research date as a capture time.
//
// Rules applied:
// - An account-based application portal (MyGovernmentOnline/MGO, GovWell, GovBuilt, Civic
//   Self Service, Development Hub, Permit Portal) is intake, not public history:
//   `records request` + `intake-or-no-history` (manual-only), portal_kind
//   `application-intake`, unless a public history search was confirmed.
// - Paper/office-only permit offices are `records request` + `custodian-only`.
// - Austin-issued records located in a city stay under Austin (FR-004c); the workflow adds
//   them to the city row as an informational count that never changes its class.
