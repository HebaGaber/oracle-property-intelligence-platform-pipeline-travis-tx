// Route table and router of the hosted UI (A-03 T007; A-13 T015). The routes are built from

// shell, so no page's code (and never DuckDB-WASM) loads until it is visited. `/` renders the Hub
// (no redirect). `routes` is exported for the unit tests (memory router); `App` mounts the
// browser router. The shared tRPC client (packages/api-client, the only one) and its React Query
// client are provided once, above the shell.
