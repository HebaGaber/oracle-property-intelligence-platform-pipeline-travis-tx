// T021 (A-14, agent-design.md § 8 "ash", § 9 "same definitions, or separate thin adapters");
// data-model.md § "agent.ask contract"): four camelCase AI SDK tools, thin adapters wired to
// packages/query-core's real functions (T011/T011a, G-1) — all four real, never stubbed, per
// /speckit-analyze finding F1. These are agent-only concerns layered over the shared query-core
// schemas: the model reads a compact (<=25-row) projection carrying each row's citation index
// `n` (so it cites `[n]`, never a CID it must invent), while EVERY row the tools return this turn
// (up to the 1,000-row cap, T035) is registered in the per-request citation registry
// (citations.ts, T019), so the server-built `matches[]` is complete. The MCP server's six tools
// (apps/api/src/mcp/tools.ts, oracle's G-3) are a separate set of thin adapters over the same
// query-core functions/schemas — not these tool objects — because the MCP contract needs full
// (<=1,000-row) envelopes with snake_case names (AD-21), which would blow the agent's token
// budget.
// A-16 (AC-13, A14-5): a tool whose run has no usable Explore index returns
// `{ error: index_not_built | index_stale, message }` instead of throwing; the out-of-area filter on
// a run with no owner area adds `owner_area: { status: "not_published" }`; and a fifth tool,
// `declareUnpublished`, lets the model state which asked-for fields the export does not carry, so
// ask.ts builds missing[] from tool results instead of the question's wording.
