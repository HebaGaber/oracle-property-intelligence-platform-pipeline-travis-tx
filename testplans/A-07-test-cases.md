# Test Cases: A-07 Enrich and reconcile (contractor identity, BBB, business/places, roof age)

> Drafted with `developmentsupport-testcases` from the story's Given/When/Then ACs (AC-1 … AC-19), its edge cases and its Requirements table (`tasks.md` was not read when this plan was first drafted, since the draft ran alongside, not after, Stage 3's `/speckit-plan`/`/speckit-tasks`; it has since been cross-checked against the final `specs/007-enrich-reconcile/tasks.md` at Stage 3 step S3.6d with no gaps found). `specs/007-enrich-reconcile/spec.md` was read for the FR numbering. This is a **pipeline-only** story: no case opens a browser. Every case starts from a terminal at the repo root on branch `007-enrich-reconcile`, in order, and gives the exact command and the exact expected output. Counts that move with the sources are given as measured on 2026-10-19/2026-10-22 and marked **(re-measured at run time)**: the case compares against the value in the run's own receipt or report, never a hard-coded figure.
>
> **D-2 (PO, 2026-10-22):** no new request goes to bbb.org in this story. Every Track B case that would otherwise hit `bbb.org` runs instead against a **local stub server** (§ 3.3), labelled "stub" in its title and side-effect class. The two real 403/challenge receipts from A-01 (`docs/evidence/blocked/`) are cited as evidence inputs, never re-captured live.

## 1. Feature overview

A-07 (merged parts A-07 identity, A-08 BBB, A-09 business/places, A-10 reconcile/roof-age) turns the A-04 backbone into trustworthy leads: a five-state contractor verdict per Austin reroof permit against the TX Comptroller Travis registry (track A); a bounded, terms-respecting BBB enrichment layer that is identity-blind (track B); Travis business records plus optionally-licensed Overture places (track C); and a TCAD-keyed duplicate merge with a sourced, versioned roof-age estimate (track D). The spec's cost-mode scope note (2026-10-22) builds tracks A and D this run; tracks B and C stay fully specified and tested against a stub/fixture so the gap is evidenced, not skipped.

## 2. Requirement mapping

## 3. Assumptions

### 3.1 G6 exceptions C-05, C-07 and C-09 (accepted for this pipeline-only story)

- **C-05 (hosted URL):** A-07 has no UI and (per the cost-mode scope note) publishes nothing in tracks B/C this run; A-11 publishes, A-13 shows it. Every case instead starts with step 0: _in a terminal at the repo root, run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`_ → `007-enrich-reconcile`. localhost is never evidence for a hosted claim, and no case here makes one.
- **C-09 (Playwright mapping):** each case maps to a named Vitest test (`-t "A-07-TC-nnn"`) in `pipeline/oracle-runtime`, to an `EN`/`RA`/`qdb_ro` command sequence, or to a read-only SQL/`grep` check, instead of a Playwright spec. § 7's Automation column names the exact handle for every case.
- **C-07 (real test data, manifest CID):** C-07 normally asks for test data traceable to a published manifest CID. A-07 is pre-publication (A-11 publishes; this story never uploads, D-3/D-4): there is no manifest CID to cite this run. Instead, every case's real-data claim traces to the registry-load watermark + snapshot digest (§ 0 Stage 0, `docs/evidence/A-07.md`) and the local job id, both captured at run time and checked against the figures in § 5. This is the accepted exception for a pre-publication pipeline story.

### 3.2 Side-effect classes

| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **read-only** | Reads files or the Query DB in a read-only session. Writes nothing outside a temp dir. |
| **writes local** | Writes `pipeline/data/` and/or the local Query DB. No external source is called. |
| **calls BBB stub** | Requests the local stub server (§ 3.3) only — **never** `bbb.org` (D-2). |
| **calls Overture** | Fetches the pinned Overture Travis release/STAC catalog, read-only, no write to any source. |

### 3.3 Fixed commands, helpers and the BBB stub (contract for this test plan; finalized at G5)

`BB` = `npm --prefix pipeline/oracle-runtime run backbone --` (A-04, read-only here). `EN` = `npm --prefix pipeline/oracle-runtime run enrich --` (new A-07 CLI, `travis/enrich/cli.ts`, same shape as `backbone`). `RA` = `node pipeline/oracle-runtime/travis/roof-age/roof-age-backfill.mjs` (flags fixed in run-log S0.6: `--state tx --county travis --source-system {permits|tcad} --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env {ENV} --limit {n} --offset {n} --coverage-state --coverage-caveats --report --apply`; dry-run is the default, `--apply` is required to write). `qdb_ro()` is the A-04 read-only Postgres helper (same local stack, same guard: any write fails with `cannot execute … in a read-only transaction`).

| Name | Exact command |
| --- | --- |
| Vitest case | `(cd pipeline/oracle-runtime && npx vitest run {file} -t "A-07-TC-nnn")` |
| Read-only qdb_ro-only case | Every case named only `` `vitest -t "A-07-TC-nnn"` (test/travis/a07/integration/qdb-checks.test.ts) `` is one named test in that single integration file — each test runs the case's own `qdb_ro` queries and asserts the exact values, so it is independently invocable by name, not a generic manual check |
| BBB stub server | `node pipeline/oracle-runtime/test/fixtures/bbb-stub-server.mjs --port 8089 --mode {default\|403-first\|403-halfway\|robots-disallow\|nr-profile}` → prints `BBB stub listening on http://127.0.0.1:8089 (mode={mode})`; kept running for the duration of each Track B case, stopped with Ctrl-C after |
| Registry load | `EN registry --load --dataset 9cir-efmm --county travis` → last line `job_id=<JOB_ID> rows_loaded=<n> watermark=<ISO-8601>`. **`{JOB_ID}` in every later step is this `job_id` value, captured once per test run from this command's own output — never guessed or reused across runs.** |
| Contractor resolve | `EN contractors --resolve --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `resolved=<n> candidate=<n> ambiguous=<n> conflicting=<n> unresolved=<n> total=<n>` |
| Contractor report | `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` |
| BBB probe (stub) | `EN bbb --probe --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --max-pages 2 --max-profiles 5 --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `requests=<n> blocked=<bool>` |
| BBB enrich (stub) | `EN bbb --enrich --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --job {JOB_ID}` |
| Business load | `EN business --load --from-job {JOB_ID}` → last line `loaded=<n> source_count=<n> watermark=<ISO-8601>` |
| Places ingest | `EN places --ingest --bbox travis-county --licence-gate` → last line `licence_gate=pass\|fail places_loaded=<n>` or `places_loaded=0 reason=<reason>` |
| Merge/reconcile | `EN merge --entity-type {owner\|contractor\|property} --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `entityType=<t> inputRecords=<n> canonical=<n>` |
| Roof-age dry-run | `RA --state tx --county travis --source-system permits --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env QDB_URL --limit 25` |
| Roof-age apply | `RA --state tx --county travis --source-system permits --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env QDB_URL --apply` → last line `rowsWritten=<n>` |
| Roof-age re-run | same command repeated immediately → last line `rowsWritten=0` |
| Query DB, read-only | `qdb_ro() { docker compose -f pipeline/local-stack/docker-compose.yml exec -T postgres psql -U postgres -d elephant -At -F '\|' -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -c 'SET default_transaction_read_only = on' -c "$1"; }` |

The as-of date is pinned at `2026-10-22` (D-9, round R2, Stage 3) and is written literally everywhere above — it is not a placeholder. `{JOB_ID}` and `{PERMIT}`/`{TCAD}` remain in the steps below; these are not unresolved placeholders but run-bound values captured from the immediately preceding command's own printed output (e.g. `EN registry --load`'s last line, or a `qdb_ro` row), exactly as A-04's test cases do — each is bound once per execution, never guessed. Exit codes follow A-04's convention: 0 ok · 2 `blocked` · 3 `waiting_human` · 4 disk guard · 64 usage · 1 other.

### 3.4 Lexicon carrier dependency (A-02)

Whether a BBB-field lexicon carrier was confirmed in A-02 decides AC-9's branch. Check first: `qdb_ro "SELECT carrier_status FROM lexicon_carriers WHERE field = 'bbb_rating';"`. If no row/`unconfirmed`, every Track B enrichment case (TC-018, TC-020, TC-021) runs the "no carrier" branch; this is the expected state for this run per the story (0 `resolved` companies expected under cost-mode scope).

## 4. Scope

- **In scope:** registry load and five-state resolution over all 22,084 Austin reroof candidates against the 342,334 Travis Comptroller records; bounded BBB probe/enrichment against the local stub only; business-record transform and Overture places ingest behind its licence gate; TCAD-keyed merge and the roof-age estimator's dry-run/apply/re-run cycle; the `0223120506` worked example.
- **Out of scope:** any live request to `bbb.org` (D-2); publication/manifest CID and the hosted UI (A-11, A-13); the BBB API application (Day-0, not code); Texas SOSDirect (OS-04); physical roof inspection.

## 5. Test data

All real, Travis County, re-measured at run time against the figures below (2026-10-19/2026-10-22 snapshot).

| Data | Snapshot (re-measured at run time) |
| --- | --- |
| TX Comptroller `9cir-efmm`, Travis county code `227` | **342,334** rows (statewide 3,487,662); **708** Travis taxpayers with "ROOF" in the name |
| Austin reroof candidates (`3syk-w9eu`) | **22,084**; **1,678** distinct printed contractor names; **15,060** with no printed name |
| Status baseline (2026-10-19) | **17,251** `Final` |
| BBB access evidence | 403/Cloudflare challenge at `2026-10-19T21:08:55.628Z` and `2026-10-20T07:23:23Z`, both in `docs/evidence/blocked/` |
| Primary roof-age anchor | TCAD id `0223120506` (pID `221829`), open replacement permit `2000-000025 BP` (`Re Review` since 2000-01-05), coordinate `gis_centroid` |
| `no_tcad_geoid` anchor | permit `1982-012866 BP` (`Suspended`, issued 1982-06-23), TCAD geoID `0208011301` — **0** matching 2026 TCAD account (A-04 evidence) |
| Overture | STAC catalog, latest release `2026-09-23.0` at Stage 0 check; licence CDLA/ODbL per theme |
| Data snapshot | No manifest CID published this run (tracks B/C are documented gaps or stub-only); snapshot named by the registry load watermark and the local job id, recorded in `docs/evidence/A-07.md` |

## 6. Environment, risks and dependencies

- macOS terminal at the repo root, branch `007-enrich-reconcile`, local stack up (`docker compose -f pipeline/local-stack/docker-compose.yml up -d`), A-04's backbone already loaded (dependency). Node ≥ 22, `restate` CLI. No AWS resource is used; no network call reaches `bbb.org` (D-2).
- The BBB stub server (§ 3.3) must be started before any Track B case and stopped after; it is test infrastructure, not production enrichment — its records are "synthetic test input", never presented as real BBB data.
- Tracks B and C may legitimately show 0 `resolved`/0 places this run (cost-mode scope note); TC-019 and TC-028 are the cases that prove the "0 is not a failure" contract.

## 8. Functional test cases

### A-07-TC-001: Exact unique active name match → `candidate` (happy path)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-1, FR-001
- **Preconditions:** `EN registry --load --dataset 9cir-efmm --county travis` has completed; a reroof permit is known whose printed company name matches exactly one active Travis Comptroller legal name (pick the first from `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number FROM reroof_candidates WHERE printed_contractor_name IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1;"`).
- **Steps:**
  1. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` → `007-enrich-reconcile`.
  2. `EN contractors --resolve --job {JOB_ID}` → completes, exit 0.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT state, printed_name, company_id FROM contractor_resolution WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` → `candidate|<name as printed>|<null>`.
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM property_improvement_has_contractor WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** state is `candidate`; the view shows the name "as printed on permit"; no company record and no `property_improvement_has_contractor` row exists for this permit.

### A-07-TC-002: Identifier crosswalk match → `resolved`

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-2, FR-002
- **Preconditions:** Stage 3's R4 crosswalk research is complete and recorded in `docs/evidence/A-07.md`; D-10 (round R2, 2026-10-22) confirmed **no official identifier crosswalk exists** between Austin's permit data and the Comptroller taxpayer number — so this run always takes the fixture branch below (the `--crosswalk-field` path does not apply to this run; it is documented in the "If a future run finds a crosswalk" note only).
- **Steps:**
  1. `(cd pipeline/oracle-runtime && npx vitest run test/contractor-resolve.test.ts -t "A-07-TC-002 labelled fixture")` → `1 passed`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT state, match_rule, source_url_permit, source_url_comptroller FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state = 'resolved';"` → `0 rows` (no live `resolved` row exists this run; the fixture proves the code path exists without a live match).
- **Expected result:** the labelled fixture test passes, proving the `resolved` code path is implemented and correct even though it produces 0 live rows this run; the live ledger has 0 `resolved` rows, consistent with D-10's negative crosswalk finding.
- **If a future run finds a crosswalk** (not this run): `EN contractors --resolve --job {JOB_ID} --crosswalk-field {field}` → `resolved=<n>`; then every `resolved` row carries the match rule version and both source URLs.

### A-07-TC-003: No Austin crosswalk → fixture-only proof + negative finding (negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@negative`
- **Maps to:** AC-2, FR-002
- **Steps:**
  1. `grep -n "3syk-w9eu\|ROW Contractor Registry" docs/evidence/A-07.md` → finds the exact negative finding: dataset `3syk-w9eu` (Issued Construction Permits) checked via `https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/3syk-w9eu.json`, its full column list present verbatim (`contractor_trade, contractor_company_name, contractor_full_name, contractor_phone, contractor_address1/2, contractor_city, contractor_zip` plus `applicant_*` — no license/tax/registry-ID field), and the City's ROW Contractor Registry cited as a PDF (not a Socrata field, not a Comptroller taxpayer number).
  2. `(cd pipeline/oracle-runtime && npx vitest run test/contractor-resolve.test.ts -t "A-07-TC-003 no-crosswalk fixture")` → `1 passed`.
- **Expected result:** `docs/evidence/A-07.md` contains the exact dataset id, its URL, its full column list, and the PDF citation verbatim (not a paraphrase); `resolved` is never produced from an un-crosswalked permit identifier; the fixture passes on synthetic input labelled as such.

### A-07-TC-004: Five-state totals sum to 22,084 (scale)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@scale @demo`
- **Maps to:** AC-3, FR-003
- **Test data:** 22,084 Austin reroof candidates (re-measured at run time); 342,334 Travis Comptroller records (re-measured at run time).
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN contractors --resolve --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `resolved=<r> candidate=<c> ambiguous=<a> conflicting=<f> unresolved=<u> total=<t>`.
  2. Verify `r + c + a + f + u == t` and `t` equals the reroof-candidate count measured in step 0 of this run (`qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM reroof_candidates;"`).
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.contractor_states.derivation == "aggregate_match"` and `coverage.contractor_states.match_rule_version` is present.
- **Expected result:** the five counts sum exactly to the measured candidate total with zero unexplained remainder; the manifest `coverage` section carries the totals with `derivation = aggregate_match` and a recorded match-rule version.

### A-07-TC-005: No printed company name → `unresolved`/`contractor_not_printed` (missing data)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@missing-data`
- **Maps to:** AC-4, FR-004
- **Test data:** 15,060 of 22,084 permits with no printed company name (re-measured at run time).
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number FROM reroof_candidates WHERE printed_contractor_name IS NULL LIMIT 1;"` → `{PERMIT}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT state, reason FROM contractor_resolution WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` → `unresolved|contractor_not_printed`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT public_contractor_text FROM v_permit WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` → `Contractor not printed on permit`.
- **Expected result:** state `unresolved`, reason `contractor_not_printed`; the UI-facing view text is exactly "Contractor not printed on permit" — never a guessed company name.

### A-07-TC-006: Comptroller registry unreachable/not loaded → all `unresolved`/`registry_unavailable` (error)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @error`
- **Maps to:** AC-5, FR-005
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN contractors --resolve --job {JOB_ID} --force-registry-unavailable` (test-only flag: the resolver runs as if the Comptroller registry were never loaded, without touching the real table — `qdb_ro "TRUNCATE comptroller_registry;"` is refused by the read-only guard and is never used).
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT DISTINCT state, reason FROM contractor_resolution WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → exactly one row `unresolved|registry_unavailable`.
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `limitations[]` contains exactly `{"reason": "registry_unavailable", "affected": "all"}`.
- **Expected result:** every contractor is `unresolved` with reason `registry_unavailable`; `limitations[]` contains the exact object `{"reason": "registry_unavailable", "affected": "all"}`; no row shows `resolved` or `candidate` purely from a name match (no name=identity fallback).

### A-07-TC-007: Two active Comptroller records share the printed name → `ambiguous` (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-1, FR-001
- **Test data:** "ABC ROOFING LLC" present active in both Austin and Pflugerville in the Comptroller load.
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM comptroller_registry WHERE legal_name = 'ABC ROOFING LLC' AND sos_status_code = 'active';"` → `2`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT state FROM contractor_resolution WHERE printed_name = 'ABC ROOFING LLC';"` → `ambiguous` for every matching permit.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM contractor_resolution_candidates WHERE printed_name = 'ABC ROOFING LLC';"` → `2`.
- **Expected result:** state `ambiguous`; both Comptroller candidate records are kept in the ledger, neither silently chosen.

### A-07-TC-008: Printed name matches a non-active `sos_status_code` → `conflicting` (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-1, FR-001
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT legal_name, sos_status_code FROM comptroller_registry WHERE sos_status_code != 'active' LIMIT 1;"` → `{NAME}|{STATUS}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT state, sos_status_shown FROM contractor_resolution WHERE printed_name = '{NAME}';"` → `conflicting|{STATUS}`.
- **Expected result:** state `conflicting`, with the non-active status shown in the record.

### A-07-TC-009: "Roofing Co." vs "ROOFING COMPANY" → normalized, still `candidate` (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-1, FR-001
- **Steps:**
  1. `(cd pipeline/oracle-runtime && npx vitest run test/name-normalize.test.ts -t "A-07-TC-009")` → `1 passed`, asserting `normalize("Roofing Co.") == normalize("ROOFING COMPANY")`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT normalization_rule_version FROM contractor_resolution WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` → a version string (e.g. `v1`).
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT state FROM contractor_resolution WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` → `candidate` (never `resolved`).
- **Expected result:** the abbreviation/punctuation variants normalize to the same key under a versioned rule; the match still yields `candidate`, never `resolved` on name alone.

### A-07-TC-010: BBB/Overture/business name match never decides identity (P0-6, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @security`
- **Maps to:** AC-10, AC-14, FR-010, FR-014
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number, printed_name FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state IN ('candidate', 'unresolved') LIMIT 1;"` → `{PERMIT}|{NAME}`.
  2. `EN business --load --from-job {JOB_ID} --fixture '{"taxpayer_number":"99999999999","legal_name":"{NAME}","mailing_address":"TEST FIXTURE, not real"}'` (a synthetic fixture row whose `legal_name` exactly equals `{NAME}`) and, separately, an Overture place fixture whose `name` exactly equals `{NAME}`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT state, reason, resolved_at FROM contractor_resolution WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` taken before and after both loads → byte-identical values both times.
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM company_record WHERE source = 'bbb' OR source = 'overture';"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** the contractor's state, reason and `resolved_at` are byte-identical before and after both the business-fixture and the place-fixture load; zero company records are ever created from a BBB or Overture name.

### A-07-TC-011: `candidate` writes no contractor link (negative, explicit DB check)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative`
- **Maps to:** AC-1, FR-002
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state = 'candidate' LIMIT 5;"` → 5 permit numbers.
  2. For each, `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM property_improvement_has_contractor WHERE permit_number = '{p}';"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** none of the 5 sampled `candidate` permits has a `property_improvement_has_contractor` row.

### A-07-TC-012: 25-row sample review: 0 `resolved` without an identifier match (NFR-001)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@scale`
- **Maps to:** NFR-001
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number, match_rule FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state = 'resolved' ORDER BY random() LIMIT 25;"` → ≤ 25 rows (fewer if `resolved` count < 25).
  2. For each row, confirm `match_rule` names an identifier crosswalk, never a bare name comparison.
- **Expected result:** 0 of the sampled `resolved` rows lack an identifier-based match rule; if `resolved = 0` this run (expected under cost-mode scope), the case passes vacuously and the report states `resolved_count = 0, sample = 0/0`.

### A-07-TC-013: Bounded BBB probe against the stub (happy path)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@security`
- **Maps to:** AC-6, FR-006
- **Preconditions:** `node pipeline/oracle-runtime/test/fixtures/bbb-stub-server.mjs --port 8089 --mode default` running.
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --probe --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --max-pages 2 --max-profiles 5 --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `requests=<n> blocked=false` with `n ≤ 7`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → equals `n`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT response_code, requested_at FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}' ORDER BY requested_at;"` → every row has a code and a timestamp; consecutive timestamps are ≥ 3 s apart.
- **Expected result:** at most 7 requests, each spaced ≥ 3 s apart, concurrency 1 (no overlapping `requested_at`/`completed_at` ranges in the log); every response code and time recorded.

### A-07-TC-014: The 8th probe request is refused by the bound (negative, edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@negative @edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-6, FR-006
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --probe --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --max-pages 99 --max-profiles 99 --job {JOB_ID}` (attempting more than the 7-request bound while the bound is still enforced by `--max-requests 7`, the fixed limit behind `--max-pages 2 --max-profiles 5`).
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → `7`.
  3. CLI stderr/log line → `request bound reached (7); refusing request 8`.
- **Expected result:** exactly 7 requests are made against the stub; the would-be 8th request is refused by the client before it is sent (never counted, never logged as a response).

### A-07-TC-015: Stub returns 403 on request 1 → stop at once (error, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @error @security`
- **Maps to:** AC-7, FR-007, NFR-002
- **Preconditions:** stub started with `--mode 403-first`.
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --probe --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --max-pages 2 --max-profiles 5 --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `requests=1 blocked=true`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → `1`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT url, response_code, requested_at, response_digest FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → one row, `response_code = 403`, all four fields non-null.
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → every row `blocked`, citing the evidence from step 3.
- **Expected result:** exactly one request is made; the run stops immediately on the 403; evidence (URL, code, time, response digest) is recorded; all unchecked contractors get `bbb_status = blocked`; no second request is ever sent.

### A-07-TC-016: Probe OK, full run 403 halfway → keep captured, mark rest `blocked` (edge, error)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge @error`
- **Maps to:** AC-7, FR-007
- **Preconditions:** stub started with `--mode 403-halfway` (serves N successful profiles, then 403 on request N+1).
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --enrich --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --job {JOB_ID}` → stops partway, exit 2.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status, count(*) FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}' GROUP BY bbb_status;"` → some rows `rated`/`not_found` (captured before the 403), the remainder `blocked`.
- **Expected result:** the ratings captured before the 403 are kept exactly as captured; every contractor after the stop point is `blocked`; the run halts and does not retry.

### A-07-TC-017: Stub `robots.txt` disallow → `blocked`/`robots_disallow` (edge, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge @negative`
- **Maps to:** AC-7, FR-007
- **Preconditions:** stub started with `--mode robots-disallow` (serves a `robots.txt` disallowing the category-pagination path).
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --probe --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --max-pages 2 --max-profiles 5 --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `requests=0 blocked=true reason=robots_disallow`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** no fetch is attempted against the disallowed path; status `blocked` with reason `robots_disallow`.

### A-07-TC-018: Every `resolved` company gets exactly one `bbb_status` (happy path)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-8, FR-008
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --enrich --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --job {JOB_ID}` completes.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT company_id, count(*) FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}' GROUP BY company_id HAVING count(*) > 1;"` → `0 rows`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → every value ∈ {`rated`, `not_found`, `blocked`, `not_checked`}.
  4. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.bbb.coverage_pct` and per-status counts present with `derivation` labels.
- **Expected result:** no `resolved` company has more than one `bbb_status` row; coverage % (rated ÷ resolved) and per-status counts are in the manifest `coverage` with `derivation`.

### A-07-TC-019: 0 `resolved` companies → coverage "not computable" (missing data, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @missing-data`
- **Maps to:** AC-8, FR-008
- **Preconditions:** this run's resolution produces 0 `resolved` companies (expected under cost-mode scope, 2026-10-22).
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state = 'resolved';"` → `0`.
  2. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.bbb.coverage_pct == "not computable"`.
- **Expected result:** the coverage percentage field is literally `"not computable"` — never `0%`, never `NaN`, never a blank.

### A-07-TC-020: No lexicon carrier → `not_checked`/`no_lexicon_carrier` (missing data)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@missing-data`
- **Maps to:** AC-9, FR-009
- **Preconditions:** `qdb_ro "SELECT carrier_status FROM lexicon_carriers WHERE field = 'bbb_rating';"` returns no row or `unconfirmed`.
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status, reason FROM v_contractor WHERE company_id IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;"` → every row `not_checked|no_lexicon_carrier`.
  2. `grep -rn "no_lexicon_carrier" docs/evidence/A-07.md` → a lexicon extension request is on file.
- **Expected result:** no BBB rating is published anywhere in the views; every contractor shows `bbb_status = not_checked` with reason `no_lexicon_carrier`; a lexicon extension request exists in evidence.

### A-07-TC-021: `resolved` + captured `blocked` + no carrier → view still `not_checked` (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-9, FR-009
- **Preconditions:** `node pipeline/oracle-runtime/test/fixtures/bbb-stub-server.mjs --port 8089 --mode 403-first` running; `qdb_ro "SELECT carrier_status FROM lexicon_carriers WHERE field = 'bbb_rating';"` returns no row or `unconfirmed`.
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --probe --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --max-pages 2 --max-profiles 5 --job {JOB_ID}` → last line `requests=1 blocked=true`; `qdb_ro "SELECT company_id FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}' LIMIT 1;"` → `{ID}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status FROM v_contractor WHERE company_id = '{ID}';"` → `not_checked` (the published view), not `blocked`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status, derivation FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE company_id = '{ID}';"` (the internal table) → `blocked|capture_time`.
- **Expected result:** the public-facing view always shows `not_checked`/`no_lexicon_carrier` when no carrier is confirmed, regardless of what was captured at request time; the internal manifest count still records the capture-time `blocked` status with its own `derivation` label — the distinction is not lost, just not surfaced through an unconfirmed carrier.

### A-07-TC-022: `candidate`/`unresolved` contractor never looked up at BBB (negative, security)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @security`
- **Maps to:** AC-10, FR-010
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state IN ('candidate', 'unresolved') LIMIT 5;"` → 5 permits.
  2. `EN bbb --enrich --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --job {JOB_ID}` completes.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM bbb_request_log l JOIN contractor_resolution c ON l.company_id = c.company_id WHERE c.permit_number IN ({5 permits});"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** none of the 5 sampled `candidate`/`unresolved` permits has any row in the BBB request log; BBB is never looked up for them, and no BBB profile ever decides their identity.

### A-07-TC-023: BBB profile shows "NR" (no rating) → `not_found` (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-8, FR-008
- **Preconditions:** stub started with `--mode nr-profile` (serves a profile page with rating text "NR").
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN bbb --enrich --stub-url http://127.0.0.1:8089 --job {JOB_ID}` completes.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT bbb_status, rated, profile_url FROM bbb_enrichment WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → `not_found|false|<url>`.
- **Expected result:** `rated = false`; status `not_found`; the profile URL is kept as evidence even though no rating value exists.

### A-07-TC-024: 0 CAPTCHA/challenge bypasses; no retry after a stop (NFR-002)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@security`
- **Maps to:** NFR-002
- **Steps:**
  1. Run TC-015 (403-first). After the stop, inspect the client source: `grep -rn "User-Agent" pipeline/oracle-runtime/travis/enrich/bbb*.ts` → one fixed User-Agent string, never rotated.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT DISTINCT user_agent, source_ip_label FROM bbb_request_log WHERE job_id = '{JOB_ID}';"` → exactly one value each.
  3. Confirm no second stub request follows the 403 within the same job (already shown by TC-015 step 2, `count = 1`).
- **Expected result:** zero challenge/CAPTCHA bypass attempts anywhere in the code path; the run stops on the first 403 and never retries with a different IP or User-Agent.

### A-07-TC-025: Business group loaded count = Comptroller Travis count at watermark (scale)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@scale`
- **Maps to:** AC-11, FR-011
- **Test data:** 342,334 Travis rows (re-measured at run time).
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN business --load --from-job {JOB_ID}` → last line `loaded=<n> source_count=<n>`.
  2. Verify `loaded == source_count` and both equal the watermark count measured at capture.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT taxpayer_number, legal_name, mailing_address, sos_file_number, source_url, captured_at FROM business_record LIMIT 1;"` → all six fields non-null.
  4. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.business.derivation == "capture_receipt"`.
- **Expected result:** the loaded count equals the source count at the capture watermark; every record keeps taxpayer number, legal name, mailing address, SOS file number, source URL and capture time; the manifest `coverage` carries the count with `derivation = capture_receipt`.

### A-07-TC-026: Comptroller row count changes during capture → receipt stores both (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-11, FR-011
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN registry --load --dataset 9cir-efmm --county travis --fixture-count-drift '{"t0":342334,"t1":342341}'` (test-only flag: a fixture Socrata adapter that reports `342334` rows on its first page-count call and `342341` on its re-read before the final page).
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count_at_start, count_at_watermark FROM capture_receipts WHERE source = '9cir-efmm';"` → exactly `342334|342341`.
- **Expected result:** the receipt records both counts exactly as given to the fixture (`342334` at start, `342341` at watermark); the loaded/business count reconciles against `342341` (the watermark count), never `342334` (the start count).

### A-07-TC-027: Overture licence gate passes → places loaded as separate group (happy path)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-12, FR-012
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN places --ingest --bbox travis-county --licence-gate` → last line `licence_gate=pass places_loaded=<n>`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT category, count(*) FROM place_record GROUP BY category ORDER BY category;"` → one row per top-level Overture category present in Travis (e.g. `accommodation|<n>`, `education|<n>`, `health_and_medical|<n>`, `retail|<n>`), each count a non-negative integer summing to the `places_loaded` value from step 1.
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `limitations[]` includes the Overture release ID and licence per theme (CDLA/ODbL).
- **Expected result:** places load as their own publication group with per-category counts; the Overture release ID and licence are recorded in the manifest limitations.

### A-07-TC-028: Licence gate fails/unreachable → "Places: not loaded · {reason}" (missing data, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @missing-data`
- **Maps to:** AC-13, FR-013
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN places --ingest --bbox travis-county --licence-gate --force-gate-fail` (test-only flag simulating an unfetchable release or failed licence check) → last line `places_loaded=0 reason=<reason>`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT reason FROM source_limitations WHERE source = 'overture_places';"` → `<reason>` present.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT public_text FROM v_coverage WHERE row_key = 'places';"` → `Places: not loaded · {reason}`.
- **Expected result:** no places are ingested; the reason is recorded in the manifest limitations; the Coverage page text is exactly `"Places: not loaded · {reason}"`, never `0`.

### A-07-TC-029: Business/place named exactly like a printed contractor → no identity change (negative, security)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @security`
- **Maps to:** AC-14, FR-014
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number, printed_name FROM contractor_resolution WHERE state = 'candidate' LIMIT 1;"` → `{PERMIT}|{NAME}`.
  2. `EN business --load --from-job {JOB_ID} --fixture '{"taxpayer_number":"88888888888","legal_name":"{NAME}","mailing_address":"TEST FIXTURE, not real"}'` (a synthetic business record whose `legal_name` is exactly `{NAME}`).
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT state FROM contractor_resolution WHERE permit_number = '{PERMIT}';"` taken before and after the load → identical, `candidate` both times.
- **Expected result:** the business load creates no identity change; the contractor's state stays exactly `candidate`, byte-identical before and after.

### A-07-TC-030: County code `227` but address outside Travis → kept, counted (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-11, FR-011
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM comptroller_registry WHERE county_code = '227' AND NOT ST_Within(address_point, travis_polygon);"` → `{n}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM business_record WHERE county_code = '227' AND NOT ST_Within(address_point, travis_polygon);"` → same `{n}` (kept, not dropped).
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.business.out_of_travis_address_count == {n}`.
- **Expected result:** these rows are kept (county code is the source's own attribution) and the count is noted separately in the manifest.

### A-07-TC-031: Overture place inside bounding box, outside county polygon → excluded (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-12, FR-012
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM overture_places_raw WHERE ST_Within(point, travis_bbox) AND NOT ST_Within(point, travis_polygon);"` → `{n}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM place_record WHERE source_id IN (SELECT id FROM overture_places_raw WHERE ST_Within(point, travis_bbox) AND NOT ST_Within(point, travis_polygon));"` → `0`.
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.places.excluded_outside_polygon_count == {n}`.
- **Expected result:** these places are excluded from `place_record` by the polygon test (not just the bounding box); the exclusion count is recorded.

### A-07-TC-032: A place with `sources[].dataset = "osm"` (any casing) stops the places load (edge, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge @negative`
- **Maps to:** AC-12, AC-13, FR-012
- **Steps:**
  1. Create the fixture `pipeline/oracle-runtime/test/fixtures/a07/overture/osm-mixed-case.geojson`: two Overture place features inside the Travis polygon, one with `sources: [{"dataset": "osm"}]` and the other with `sources: [{"dataset": "OSM"}]` (identical otherwise to a passing fixture place).
  2. `EN places --ingest --bbox travis-county --licence-gate --input pipeline/oracle-runtime/test/fixtures/a07/overture/osm-mixed-case.geojson` → exits before loading, last line `places_loaded=0 reason=osm_source_licence_boundary`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM place_record;"` → `0` (the whole load stopped, not a partial filter).
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT reason FROM source_limitations WHERE source = 'overture_places';"` → `osm_source_licence_boundary`.
- **Expected result:** encountering any OSM-sourced place (case-insensitive match on `dataset`) halts the entire places load rather than silently filtering just that record; the licence-boundary reason is recorded in the manifest limitations and the Coverage page shows the "not loaded · {reason}" text (TC-028's pattern).

### A-07-TC-033: Loaded count = source count; licence recorded for 100% of groups (NFR-003)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@scale`
- **Maps to:** NFR-003
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.business.loaded == coverage.business.source_count_at_watermark`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM published_groups WHERE licence IS NULL;"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** the business count exactly equals the source count at the watermark; every published group (business, places if loaded) has a non-null licence recorded.

### A-07-TC-034: `0223120506`/pID `221829` — open permit does not reset roof age (happy path, demo)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@demo @pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-15, FR-015
- **Test data:** TCAD id `0223120506` (pID `221829`), open replacement permit `2000-000025 BP` (`Re Review` since 2000-01-05), coordinate `gis_centroid`.
- **Steps:**
  1. `RA --state tx --county travis --source-system permits --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env QDB_URL --tcad-id 0223120506` (the estimator's single-property fixture mode, targeting pID `221829` directly — not the 25-row random sample, so this case does not depend on the draw).
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_confidence, roof_age_years FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '0223120506';"` → `basis ∈ {permit, built_year}` (never reset to a fresh/zero age from the open `2000-000025 BP`), `confidence` matching the basis, `roof_age_years` computed from the chosen anchor.
  3. `grep -n "0223120506" docs/evidence/A-07.md` → the worked example lists every source record (permit rows, TCAD account, GIS feature), each with URL, capture time and digest.
- **Expected result:** the open permit `2000-000025 BP` is never treated as the roof-age anchor; the anchor is the latest *final* replacement permit for this property or, failing that, the built year; `roof_age_basis`/`roof_age_confidence` are recorded; the evidence file's worked example is fully sourced.

### A-07-TC-035: Permit `1982-012866 BP` → `0208011301` has no 2026 TCAD account (negative, edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-15, FR-015
- **Test data:** permit `1982-012866 BP` (`Suspended`, issued 1982-06-23), TCAD geoID `0208011301` — 0 matching 2026 TCAD accounts (A-04 evidence).
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM parcels WHERE tcad_geoid = '0208011301';"` → `0`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT unmatched_reason FROM property_improvements WHERE permit_number = '1982-012866 BP';"` → `no_tcad_geoid`.
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.roof_age.excluded.no_tcad_geoid >= 1`, including this permit.
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_years FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '0223120506';"` (re-check the primary anchor, unaffected) → unchanged from TC-034's step 2 value.
- **Expected result:** this open-status permit carries no property to assign a roof age to — it is excluded from roof-age coverage with reason `no_tcad_geoid`, never silently dropped and never used to reset or affect any other property's roof age (confirmed unchanged on `0223120506`).

### A-07-TC-036: Basis/confidence by anchor type (happy path)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-16, FR-016
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT tcad_id FROM property_improvements WHERE status_class = 'closed' AND status = 'Final' LIMIT 1;"` → `{TCAD_FINAL}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_confidence, roof_age_years FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD_FINAL}';"` → `permit|high|<as_of − final_date>`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT tcad_id FROM property_improvements WHERE permit_type = 'new_construction' LIMIT 1;"` → `{TCAD_NEW}`; `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_confidence FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD_NEW}';"` → `new_construction|medium`.
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT tcad_id FROM parcels p WHERE year_built IS NOT NULL AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM property_improvements pi WHERE pi.tcad_id = p.tcad_id AND pi.permit_type = 'roofing') LIMIT 1;"` → `{TCAD_YEARONLY}`; `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_confidence FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD_YEARONLY}';"` → `built_year|low`.
- **Expected result:** each of the three sampled properties (`{TCAD_FINAL}`, `{TCAD_NEW}`, `{TCAD_YEARONLY}`) yields exactly the specified basis/confidence pair for its anchor type; `roof_age_years` for the `permit` case equals the run's `as_of` date (`2026-10-22`) minus the permit's final date.

### A-07-TC-037: Two `Final` reroof permits on the same property → latest wins (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-15, FR-015
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT permit_number, final_date FROM property_improvements WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD}' AND status = 'Final' ORDER BY final_date DESC;"` → ≥ 2 rows.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis_source_permit FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD}';"` → equals the top (latest) row's permit number.
  3. `grep -n "{TCAD}" docs/evidence/A-07.md` → the earlier permit still appears in the lineage.
- **Expected result:** the latest `Final` date is the anchor; the earlier `Final` permit is kept in lineage, not discarded.

### A-07-TC-038: `Expired` reroof permit, no final → not an anchor (edge)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge`
- **Maps to:** AC-15, FR-015
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT pi.tcad_id, pi.permit_number FROM property_improvements pi JOIN parcels p ON p.tcad_id = pi.tcad_id WHERE pi.status = 'Expired' AND pi.final_date IS NULL AND p.year_built IS NOT NULL AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM property_improvements pi2 WHERE pi2.tcad_id = pi.tcad_id AND pi2.status = 'Final') LIMIT 1;"` → `{TCAD}|{EXPIRED_PERMIT}` (a property with no other `Final` permit, so the only remaining anchor is the built year).
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_basis_source_permit FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD}';"` → `built_year|<null>`.
- **Expected result:** `roof_age_basis = built_year`, and `roof_age_basis_source_permit` is never `{EXPIRED_PERMIT}`; the stalled `Expired` permit never anchors a roof age — it remains a lead signal only, visible elsewhere (e.g. open-permit lists) but not in the roof-age basis.

### A-07-TC-039: Year built in the future or before 1850 → `unknown` + reason (edge, negative)

- **Priority / tags:** P2 · `@edge @negative`
- **Maps to:** AC-16, FR-016
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT tcad_id, year_built FROM parcels WHERE year_built > extract(year from now()) OR year_built < 1850 LIMIT 1;"` → `{TCAD}|{YEAR}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_reason FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD}';"` → `unknown|invalid_year_built`.
- **Expected result:** the invalid year is flagged, never used; basis `unknown` with the reason recorded.

### A-07-TC-040: Full-roll roof-age coverage; 25-property audit 25/25 (scale)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@scale`
- **Maps to:** AC-17, FR-017
- **Steps:**
  1. `RA --state tx --county travis --source-system permits --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env QDB_URL --coverage-state --coverage-caveats --report` → prints coverage by `roof_age_basis`/`roof_age_confidence` (counts and %) over all N properties from A-04.
  2. `RA --state tx --county travis --source-system permits --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env QDB_URL --limit 25` (dry-run audit) → 25 rows.
  3. For each of the 25, compare the dry-run's derivation against `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_confidence, roof_age_years FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{tcad}';"` → identical on all fields.
- **Expected result:** coverage is reported by basis and confidence as counts and percentages over the full roll; the 25-property audit agrees with the view derivation on 25/25.

### A-07-TC-041: Immediate re-run writes `rowsWritten: 0` (scale, idempotency, NFR-004)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@scale`
- **Maps to:** AC-17, FR-017, NFR-004
- **Steps:**
  1. `RA --state tx --county travis --source-system permits --as-of-date 2026-10-22 --database-url-env QDB_URL --apply` → last line `rowsWritten=<n>` (n ≥ 0, first apply).
  2. Immediately re-run the identical command → last line `rowsWritten=0`.
- **Expected result:** the second, immediate run over the same scope writes exactly `rowsWritten: 0` — full idempotency.

### A-07-TC-042: Merge counts per entity type (happy path)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@pipeline`
- **Maps to:** AC-18, FR-018
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN merge --entity-type property --job {JOB_ID}` → `entityType=property inputRecords=<n> canonical=<m>`.
  2. Repeat for `owner` and `contractor`.
  3. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.merge[]` contains one `{entityType, inputRecords, canonical}` object per entity type with `derivation = aggregate_match`.
  4. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM company_record cr JOIN contractor_merge_cluster m ON cr.company_id = m.company_id WHERE cr.state != 'resolved';"` → `0`.
- **Expected result:** the manifest carries one merge object per entity type with the aggregate counts and `derivation = aggregate_match`; contractor clusters are merged only where identity is `resolved` (0 non-`resolved` companies in any cluster).

### A-07-TC-043: A merge attempt across two distinct TCAD ids is refused (negative, security)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@negative @security`
- **Maps to:** AC-18, FR-018
- **Steps:**
  1. `EN merge --entity-type property --job {JOB_ID} --force-cross-tcad-test '{"a":"0223120506","b":"{OTHER_TCAD}"}'` (test-only flag simulating a would-be cross-TCAD join).
  2. CLI exit code **1** (domain-level refusal, per `contracts/cli.md`'s exit-code table); stderr line exactly: `merge refused: distinct TCAD ids 0223120506, {OTHER_TCAD}`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM parcels WHERE tcad_id = '0223120506' AND tcad_id = '{OTHER_TCAD}';"` — logically impossible, confirming no row exists with two TCAD ids.
  4. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.merge_refusals.cross_tcad_attempted >= 1`.
- **Expected result:** exit code 1 and the exact stderr line above; the merge is refused outright (TCAD id is the key, never crossed); the refusal is counted in the manifest at `coverage.merge_refusals.cross_tcad_attempted`, not silently dropped.

### A-07-TC-044: No roofing permit and no year built → `unknown`/`none`, excluded from "roof > 15" (missing data)

- **Priority / tags:** P1 · `@missing-data`
- **Maps to:** AC-19, FR-019
- **Steps:**
  1. `qdb_ro "SELECT tcad_id FROM parcels p WHERE year_built IS NULL AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM property_improvements pi WHERE pi.tcad_id = p.tcad_id AND pi.permit_type = 'roofing') LIMIT 1;"` → `{TCAD}`.
  2. `qdb_ro "SELECT roof_age_basis, roof_age_confidence, roof_age_years FROM v_property WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD}';"` → `unknown|none|<null>`.
  3. `qdb_ro "SELECT count(*) FROM v_roof_over_15 WHERE tcad_id = '{TCAD}';"` → `0`.
  4. `EN contractors --report --job {JOB_ID} --json` → `coverage.roof_age.gap_count` includes this property.
- **Expected result:** `roof_age_basis = unknown`, `roof_age_confidence = none`, `roof_age_years` is `null`; the property is excluded from "roof > 15" results but is counted in the coverage gap; no date is invented anywhere in the record.

## 9. Edge cases

All 15 of the story's edge cases are covered above: see A-07-TC-007, 008, 009, 010, 023, 030, 031, 032, 037, 038, 039 and the no-`tcad_geoid` case A-07-TC-035. Two further boundary notes:

- The BBB stub's `403-halfway` mode (TC-016) exercises the "ratings already captured are kept" rule without a second live request.
- TC-026 (Comptroller row count drift mid-capture) and TC-033 (100% licence coverage) are the only cases that touch watermark/receipt mechanics rather than a single record's state.

## 10. Gap-linked cases (expected to fail until fixed)

| TC ID | Asserts | Gap | Defect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-07-TC-027 | Overture places load behind a passing licence gate | Track C builds only if tracks A and D merge before 2026-10-23 12:00 EEST (spec cost-mode scope note); otherwise this is a documented gap, not a failure | — |
| A-07-TC-002 | `resolved` via an official identifier crosswalk | Stage 3's R4 research may find no Austin-published crosswalk field; if so, TC-002/TC-003 pass only via the labelled fixture branch | — |
| A-07-TC-018, TC-019, TC-023 | BBB enrichment over `resolved` companies | 0 `resolved` companies are expected this run (cost-mode scope); these cases are designed to pass vacuously or via the stub, never to fabricate a live BBB result | — |
