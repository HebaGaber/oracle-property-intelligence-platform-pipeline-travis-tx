// gateways per AM-10 2026-10-26, which amends AM-01 and P0-14; A-16 T078): independent proof
// that every published artifact is what the committed manifest says, read from public gateways
// in two clearly separated roles:
//
//   independent  gateway.pinata.cloud (Pinata's public gateway) and ipfs.orbitor.dev (an
//                independent operator). An artifact passes ONLY when BOTH match size + SHA-256.
//   fallback     ipfs.filebase.io, our storage host. Its result is printed alongside, labelled
//                "storage host, not independent", and never counts as an independent check.
//
// Nothing else is ever read: ipfs.io and dweb.link retired on 2026-09-21 (every request answers
// 429 with a Sunset header; docs/decisions/0001-read-path.md Finding 3), storacha.link and
// w3s.link belong to Storacha, whose upload service ended 2026-04-15 (storacha.link now redirects
// to dweb.link), and our CloudFront CID copy is serve infrastructure we run. All of them, and any
// other host, are refused before the first request: they would prove nothing a stranger could
// not fake by trusting us (or prove nothing at all). dget.top was tested 2026-10-26 and timed out.
//
//   npx tsx scripts/verify-manifest.ts runs/<runId>/manifest.json [--gateway <url>]... [--verbose]
//       [--resume-from <prior-log>] [--json <evidence.json>]
//   npx tsx scripts/verify-manifest.ts runs/<runId>/manifest.json --sample      (CI, very small)
//
// `--json <path>` also writes a machine-readable evidence file (schema
// `verify-manifest-evidence.v1`): per artifact the cid, name, expected size + SHA-256, a
// per-gateway { role, status, ok, bytes, sha256, ms } map and `independent_ok`, plus a summary.
//
// `--sample` (PO decision 2026-10-25) checks the manifest itself on every gateway exactly as
// below, then only two artifacts: the smallest table part and the smallest CAR (by size, then
// name). A full-county run lists 225 table parts and 15 CARs (about 2.8 GB of CARs) and a full
// check took about two hours locally because Pinata answers 429, so the hosted job checks a
// sample. In a sample the CAR is read from Filebase only (Pinata's gateway answers 429 to CAR
// downloads, and AM-10 keeps the CARs on Filebase plus the GitHub Release, not on Pinata); the
// output says so plainly: a Filebase-only CAR read is a storage-host read, NOT an independent
// check. The manifest and the table part are still read from both independent gateways. A sample
// prints SAMPLE VERIFIED, never ALL ARTIFACTS VERIFIED, and exits 3 when it passes (0 is reserved
// for a full verification; 1 = a check failed; 2 = usage). The default (no flag) is the full
// check the operator runs after a publish.
//
// Order: the manifest itself, by its own raw-leaves CIDv1, from every gateway, compared
// byte-for-byte with the local file; the run stops before any artifact is checked when either
// independent gateway does not match, or when any gateway (fallback included) answers 200 with
// other bytes. Then every artifact: tables by `cid`, car/directory artifacts by `carCid` (never
// the dag-json root as a file). Every GET retries 429/504/timeout up to MAX_ATTEMPTS (5) with
// backoff honouring `Retry-After`; TIMEOUT_MS (default 300000 ms) bounds each attempt. A redirect
// is followed only when its target stays on the same gateway's domain (host-generic: covers a
// CID-subdomain redirect such as dweb.link's old `<cid>.ipfs.dweb.link` pattern) — any redirect
// elsewhere is a failed check, never followed. A miss of any kind marks that check `unverified`
// and the run exits non-zero; printing `ALL ARTIFACTS VERIFIED` (exit 0) requires the manifest
// and every artifact to match on BOTH independent gateways. The body is hashed while streaming
// (never buffered whole), so an artifact over 50 MB is checked the same way as a small one
// (NFR-06).
