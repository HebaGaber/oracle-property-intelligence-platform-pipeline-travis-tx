# Coverage: Travis County denominators vs published counts

The denominators come from the A-01 discovery catalog. Each one has its source URL and UTC capture time in `pipeline/docs/travis-sources.yaml`, and `docs/sources.md` renders them. A-11 fills the "Published" and "Coverage" columns from the CLI-exported Atlas tables. Until then they read "not published yet".
