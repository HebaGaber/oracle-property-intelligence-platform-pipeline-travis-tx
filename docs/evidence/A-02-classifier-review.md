# A-02 classifier review (AC-3, PO decision D-7)

Profile `travis-austin@1.0.0` (sha256 `c8fd15cf8deb654c2959d7cca3b05560bc9830de2518c56a092bd87bdf53dfa6`) applied to 25 Austin permits drawn from the 65437 permits whose description or work class mentions ROOF (captured 2026-10-20T21:34:28.982Z).

**How they were drawn:** every permit number in the population was ranked by `sha256(seed + "\n" + permit_number)` with the seed above; the 25 smallest digests are listed in rank order. Anyone can redo the draw from the seed and the population.

**Pass (FR-003, NFR-001):** at least 24 of 25 marked right, at most 1 `needs_review`, and 0 solar/PV/RTU permits accepted as roofing.

**Profile verdicts:** 9 roofing, 16 not roofing, 0 needs_review.

Mark the last column ✔ (the verdict is right) or ✘ (wrong). The status note says how the status word is published (D-4a: Expired stays Expired and is published with improvement_status null).
