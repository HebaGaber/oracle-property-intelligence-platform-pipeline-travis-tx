# QC Test Report: A-13 Build the Explorer UI with its hub, legal, catalog and Coming soon pages

Every case in `testplans/A-13-test-cases.md` (73 cases, TC-001 to TC-086) runs against the **hosted** Amplify branch preview `https://013-explorer-and-pages.d2lx0utip89u18.amplifyapp.com`. No case ran on localhost (TC-085 proves the harness refuses it). The production URL `https://countylens.aldarraj.com` serves `feature/oracle-pipeline` until the G7 merge.

**Final result on the GitHub runner (CI run 39835352646, preview built from code `2cc58ac`, 2026-10-22): 72 of 73 cases pass, including TC-040; 1 is skipped (TC-015, waits for A-11). Every A-13 TC except TC-015 has a PASS on the hosted URL on the final build; see "Final verification on the GitHub runner" below.** On the author's slow home link, build `2e14516` gave: 71 of 73 cases pass; 1 is skipped (TC-015, "waits for A-11 (PO D-1/D-2)"); 1 failed on a slow link (TC-040, first load of the in-browser SQL engine, limit 8 s).** By phase: general 59 passed, 1 skipped (2 workers, 16.6 min); verify 8 of 8; vitals 2 of 2 (TC-058, TC-081); perf: TC-040 failed (11.2 to 25.7 s), TC-041 and TC-082 passed when run alone. The first complete suite, 72 of 73 passing (TC-040 passed at 4.1 to 4.6 s), ran on `015fbf9`; run 5 and run 6 below.

**TC-040 in plain words.** The engine's compressed file is 8.09 MB; with the other files the page fetches about 11 MB in parallel. On the faster link of the morning the first load took 4.1 to 4.6 s; on the slower link of the evening, 1.1 to 1.5 MB/s at 14:55 and 0.39 then 0.78 MB/s at 16:50, it took 11.2 to 25.7 s. The page and the files did not change in a way that could account for it (ERR-46 removed Google requests, which the waterfall now confirms). PO decision (2026-10-22, "Record both measurements, keep the 8 s limit (Recommended)"): the limit stays 8 s, no code change, and G7 lists TC-040 as "passes at 1.4 MB/s or faster". TC-040 also passes on the GitHub runner in the final CI run (39835352646, perf phase 13 of 13 passed). Both measurements are in [../evidence/A-13-duckdb.md](../evidence/A-13-duckdb.md).

**The published run is a slice, so every scale number below is provisional.** The only published run, `travis-202609-permits-20261021t103516z`, holds 14 properties and 35 reroof permits (22 open, 13 closed, 0 stalled). TC-040 and TC-041 timings, TC-058 and the Catalog and Coverage cases are therefore measured on that slice and marked "provisional until A-11" in the evidence files the tests write. They do not prove the full-county behaviour.

## Final verification on the GitHub runner (CI run 39835352646)

GitHub Actions run 39835352646, commit `2c13e09` (code identical to `2cc58ac`; the commit differs only in `docs/` and `specs/`), 2026-10-22, conclusion **success**. The `e2e-hosted` job ran three Playwright steps against the Amplify preview `https://013-explorer-and-pages.d2lx0utip89u18.amplifyapp.com` (the Amplify build of the same push).

| Step | Workers | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A-03 cases | 1 | **38 passed** (includes A-03-TC-NF-03, the permits first-viewport rule at 390, and A-03-TC-061) |
| A-13 general (explorer, pages, scan) | 4 | **59 passed, 1 skipped** (TC-015, waits for A-11) |
| A-13 Verify, performance, vitals | 1 | **13 passed** (the 8 Verify cases, TC-040, TC-041, TC-082, TC-058, TC-081) |
| Total A-13 | | **72 passed, 1 skipped** (59 + 13 passed; 73 cases in the plan) |

The other jobs of the run (`gitleaks`, `workspace`, `oracle-runtime`) also succeeded; the `workspace` job holds the unit tests, the coverage gates and the bundle gate (see [A-13-unit-test-report.md](A-13-unit-test-report.md)).

**Every A-13 test case except TC-015 has a PASS on the hosted URL on the final build.** TC-015 stays skipped because the "still resolves" pill needs two published runs (A-11).

**TC-040 has two measurements and now a third.** It failed on the author's slow home link (11 to 26 s at 0.4 to 1.5 MB/s), passed earlier on the same link when it was faster (4.1 to 4.6 s), and passes on the GitHub runner in this run. The PO decision stands (keep the 8 s limit, record both measurements, no code change). Detail: [../evidence/A-13-duckdb.md](../evidence/A-13-duckdb.md) and the Non-functional results table below.

Runs of the same CI job before the final one, for the record:

| CI run | Commit | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 39808557005 | `c5c21f3` | `e2e-hosted` failed: token audit (the -16 px margin, ERR-47 attempt 1), permits first viewport 940.8 px on the runner, TC-008 race (ERR-48), A-03-TC-061 |
| 39819086782 | | `workspace` failed on timing races in web unit tests (ERR-49) |
| 39826467354 | | `workspace` failed on timing races in web unit tests (ERR-49) |
| 39828569416 | `2cc58ac` | all jobs green except A-03-TC-061 (a stale SHA in an evidence file; 37 A-03 cases passed, A-13 59 + 1 skipped, 13 of 13) |
| **39835352646** | `2c13e09` (code `2cc58ac`) | **all jobs success** |

## Run history

Six full hosted runs, each on its own preview build, 2026-10-22 (runs 1 to 5 times are UTC; run 6 and the intermediate row use the operator clock, UTC+3, as the run-log does). Start times are the Playwright JSON `startTime` (UTC). Each defect fix was pushed to the fork, Amplify built the branch, `/build.json` was read, and the suite was run again.

| Run | Build | Start (UTC) | General phase (60 cases) | Verify (8) | Perf (3) | Vitals (2) | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `641bc25` | 04:10 | 44 pass, **15 fail**, 1 skipped (TC-002, 003, 008, 009, 012, 014, 016, 039, 042, 071, 072, 073 timed out at 1,800 s, 080, 083, 086) | 6 pass, 1 fail (TC-023), TC-024 skipped behind it | TC-040 pass, TC-041 timed out at 300 s, TC-082 skipped behind it | TC-058 pass, TC-081 fail | Baseline: 18 failing cases (15 + 1 + 1 + 1), recorded as ERR-21 to ERR-37 |
| 2 | `a285dbe` | 05:09 | 57 pass, 2 fail (TC-009 checkbox state, TC-073 scan), 1 skipped | **void** | **void** | **void** | Verify, perf and vitals ran while another Playwright process shared `tests/e2e/test-results` (ENOENT on trace files); the results were discarded and the process stopped. General phase counts. ERR-38 (smeargle) to ERR-40 found |
| 3 | `d3ae47e` | 05:36 | 57 pass, 2 fail (TC-072 filter sheet 406 px, TC-073 click on a row after the SQL tab unmounted), 1 skipped | 8 pass | 3 pass | TC-058 pass, TC-081 fail (Data · Catalog median LCP 4,836 ms) | Clean run, nothing else on `tests/e2e`. ERR-41 found |
| 4 | `7f04685` | 06:09 | 58 pass, 1 fail (TC-072, 406 px, second time under 4-worker load), 1 skipped | 8 pass | 3 pass | 2 pass | ERR-42 root cause found by delaying `explore.search` by 4 s |
| 5 | `015fbf9` | 06:38 | 59 pass, 0 fail, 1 skipped (TC-015) | 8 pass | 3 pass | 2 pass | 72 pass / 1 skipped. First complete green run |
| (between) | `32a3d60` | 13:59 to 14:31 | 58 pass, 1 fail (TC-073: screenshot timed out "waiting for fonts to load"), 1 skipped | 8 pass | TC-040 **fail** (12.3 s; 9 to 18 s repeated) | TC-058 pass, TC-081 fail (Catalog 2,656 ms, Coverage 2,572 ms) | ERR-46 found (also: `dfed5b0` failed TC-056, ERR-45; `5fdac1a`, `34c8eaf` ran partial re-checks) |
| 6 (final) | **`2e14516`** | clean run 16:06 to 16:28; general again 16:28 to 16:45 | clean run: 57 pass, 2 fail, 1 skipped (TC-053 columns counted before the progressive Parquet footers arrived; TC-073 explore-wide at 390 waited 15 s for its data state under 4 workers). Both are **test defects**, fixed in the tests (wait for the pending notes; 30 s). General phase re-run with 2 workers: **59 pass, 0 fail, 1 skipped** | **8 pass** | TC-040 **fail** (11.2 to 13.0 s; latest 11.4 to 25.7 s); TC-041 and TC-082 skipped behind it, then run alone: **pass** | **2 pass** | **71 pass, 1 skipped, 1 fail (TC-040, slow link).** Evidence build |

Numbers come from the Playwright JSON reports of each run (`stats.expected`, `stats.unexpected`, `stats.skipped`). Run 1 counts 15 failed in its general phase; the run-log first recorded 13 at the 07:40 (EEST) triage, while 3 long scan cases were still running, and the two late ones are TC-083 and TC-073. The run-log wording for run 3 ("general 57 pass / 2 fail") and run 4 ("58 / 1") matches the JSON.

## Results

Result columns: "Result on 2e14516" is the final run (every case marked PASS also passed on `015fbf9` in run 5; TC-040 is the exception, marked below). "Earlier runs" lists the result in runs 1 to 4 in order (`void` = discarded run 2 phases, see the history). "waits A-11" marks the 11 cases the plan tags that way; the next section says what each checked today. Cases are grouped by the Playwright file that holds them. Every row is one `@scenario:A-13-TC-nnn` test.

## Cases that wait for A-11

Eleven cases carry the plan's "Waits for A-11 (PO D-1/D-2, 2026-10-21)" label. A-11 has not published runs 2 and 3, the full county, `tables-export.json` or run events. Each case ran its "today" branch on the single published run and reported that branch in the test annotations (`a11-branch`). 10 of the 11 pass today (TC-040 included on the GitHub runner, CI run 39835352646; it failed on the author's slow link on `2e14516`, see its row); their full assertions switch on automatically once `runs/index.json` holds at least 3 runs. TC-015 is skipped (the only A-13 case without a PASS).

| TC | Result | What it checked today (single run, 14 properties, 35 permits) | What A-11 adds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TC-007 D-7 Compare | PASS | `/runs/compare` says "first run · nothing to compare against"; the single manifest CID resolves with HTTP 200 on Pinata and on Filebase (`A-13-TC-007-today.png`) | Run 3 vs Run 2: distinct CIDs, `previousManifestCid` link, resolve pill, CAR links |
| TC-008 D-8 roof age | PASS | Pflugerville 5 mi, roof ≥ 15: header, engine line "DuckDB on the server · same views", the server total equals the list and the browser SQL count of the same filter; Pflugerville holds 0 properties, so the zero-results line shows (see `A-13-roof-age.md` for the Austin demo area, 3 properties) | Full county, n > 0, rows sorted nearest |
| TC-009 D-9 open permits | PASS | No permit is open ≥ 5 years (longest open 47 days): 0 rows and the exact line "no open roofing permits in this radius on the current run" (`A-13-open-permits.md`) | Oldest open or stalled reroofs of the full county, from 2004 |
| TC-015 resolve pill | **SKIPPED** | Skipped with the reason "1 run published": the pill needs two runs | Pill only after both gateways answer for the old CID |
| TC-019 file > 50 MB | PASS | No artifact in this run exceeds 50 MB (recorded); every file ≤ 50 MB shows "Verify" | Every file > 50 MB shows "Verify via CAR" |
| TC-031 chips and sort | PASS | `permits_emitted_stalled` is 0 and no permit is open ≥ 5 years: the list is empty with the exact message (`A-13-TC-031-today.png`) | Stalled and open chips sorted by open longest |
| TC-040 first DuckDB load | **FAIL on `2e14516` (slow link)**; PASS on `015fbf9` and on the runner (CI run 39835352646) | `2e14516`: 11,159 to 25,719 ms (limit 8,000 ms), progress bar shown; `015fbf9`: 4,123 to 4,607 ms; **provisional** (slice; the time is the engine download) | Same test on full-county tables, on a link whose speed is recorded |
| TC-041 search p95 | PASS | 20 distinct radii per series: radius + roof p50 1,320 ms, p95 1,837 ms; open-permit p50 812 ms, p95 1,313 ms (limit 3,000 ms); **provisional** (slice) | Same test on full-county tables |
| TC-053 Catalog | PASS | 23 table rows from the manifest (16 `tables/county/*`, 7 `tables/property_improvement/*`), columns from each Parquet footer, notice "table export not in this run's manifest" | Columns from `tables-export.json` |
| TC-057 Runs · Log | PASS | The 4 events of the single run (start, two source captures, finish with 3 limitations) in time order with the run ID | All events of at least 3 runs |
| TC-058 Runs · Log LCP | PASS | Median LCP 2,452 ms, CLS 0.000 on the Lighthouse mobile profile (150 ms RTT, 1.6 Mbps, 4x CPU, 390 px, median of 5); **provisional** (1 run) | Same test with at least 3 runs |

## Defects

All 26 defects were found in the hosted runs of 2026-10-22 on branch `013-explorer-and-pages`. "Fix commit" is the first push that carried the fix. "Re-test" is the final run: `015fbf9` for ERR-21 to ERR-42, `2e14516` for ERR-43 to ERR-46; a TC listed under ERR-n passed there. None is Critical.

Two further test-side failures in the clean run on `2e14516` (TC-053 and TC-073, see run 6) were fixed in the tests and did not get ERR numbers.

No open finding outside the 73 cases: smeargle N3 (`/help/mcp`, 390 px, `main` scrolls sideways) is ERR-43, fixed in `34c8eaf` and re-measured on the hosted build. TC-080 measures the document, not `main`, so it could not have caught it; the smeargle cell did.

Notes: (1) The `docs/defects/ERR-21.md` to `ERR-42.md` files still read "Fixed, re-test pending (hosted)" with empty `fix_commit` and `retest_date`; the table above is the re-test record until they are closed at G7. ERR-43 to ERR-48 are closed in their files (ERR-47 and ERR-48 re-tested PASS in CI run 39835352646). (2) Product fixes of ERR-21 to ERR-32 were written with their tests, not seen red first, as the run-log records. (3) TC-072 failed once at 406 px under 4-worker load in runs 3 and 4 and could not be reproduced in 6 clean single runs on `d3ae47e`; it was reproduced only by delaying `explore.search` (ERR-42) and passes on `015fbf9`.

## Sign-off
