# QC Test Report: A-01 Discover Travis County sources and pass readiness preflight

Every case in `testplans/A-01-test-cases.md` (v0.6, 30 cases) was run from the repository root on branch `001-discover-sources`, through its automated test: `pipeline/oracle-runtime/test/acceptance/a01.acceptance.test.ts` (one test per CLI case, `npm run test:acceptance`) and the unit tests the plan names for UNIT cases. There is no hosted URL in A-01 (G4 C-04 exception), so every hosted-URL field reads "N/A: Project story, no hosted runtime until A-03".

## Runs

| Run | Start (UTC) | Commit | Passed / failed / skipped (of 26 automated) | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2026-10-20T15:31:25Z | `a96d669` + ERR-1 fix | 11 / 13 / 2 | first end-to-end run of the suite; ERR-2 found |
| 2 | about 15:34Z | + ERR-2 fix | 16 / 8 / 2 | ERR-3 to ERR-7 found |
| 3 | 15:36:34Z | + ERR-3, ERR-5, ERR-6, ERR-7 fixes (uncommitted) | 22 / 2 / 2 | TC-022 failed only on the uncommitted `docs/sources.md` |
| **Final** | **15:38:39Z** | **`9c7579a`** | **23 / 1 / 2** | 24 s; plus TC-008, TC-026, TC-NF-01 unit cases PASS |
| Re-test | after 15:40Z | ERR-4 accepted | TC-009: 1 / 0 / 0 | TC-009 step 4 accepts a documented missing date |

Live requests made by the suite (open-data sources only, each with the project's identified User-Agent after ERR-1): Comptroller `data.texas.gov` (TC-005), Austin `data.austintexas.gov` (TC-006, TC-014), GitHub API (TC-020, `gh run list`). No blocked source was contacted. While diagnosing ERR-3, three manual count queries went to Austin's open-data API; one of them carried a truncated form of the project User-Agent.

| A-01-TC-009 | AC-3 | Happy path, scale | PASS (after ERR-4 accepted) | ERR-4 | roll 493,246; key `pID` (layout `prop_id`), proven; deed or sale dates present; `certification_date` missing with its reason (the TCAD page states none), source and capture time; failed in the final run, passed on re-test after the PO accepted the gap |

## Non-functional results

| TC ID | NFR | Tool | Result | Actual | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-01-TC-NF-01 | Source etiquette (NFR-001) | Vitest unit (`A-01-TC-NF-01 etiquette`) | PASS | 6 tests: ≤ 2 in flight per host, constant identified User-Agent, no proxy or rotation | concurrency ≤ 2; 0 bypasses |
| A-01-TC-NF-02 | Measurement stays a measurement | acceptance | PASS | 3 pages × 50,000 = 150,000 rows read; raw data holds only the TCAD export and the 16-byte US-runner count | ≤ 150,000 rows; no bulk download beyond TCAD |
| A-01-TC-NF-03 | Discovery within 8 h (SC-006) | acceptance | PASS | run `travis-2` discovery time within 8 h after subtracting 7.72 h waiting for a human | ≤ 8 h |

## Defects

| ERR | TC | Severity | Status | Fix commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ERR-1 | TC-005, TC-006, TC-014 | Medium | Fixed + re-tested ✅ (found before the run) | `9c7579a` |
| ERR-2 | TC-005, 007, 010, 013, NF-02, NF-03 | High | Fixed + re-tested ✅ | `9c7579a` |
| ERR-3 | TC-006 | Medium | Fixed + re-tested ✅ | `9c7579a` |
| ERR-4 | TC-009 | Medium | Closed: accepted by the PO 2026-10-20 (documented gap); TC-009 re-tested PASS | this commit |
| ERR-5 | TC-022 | High | Fixed + re-tested ✅ | `9c7579a` |
| ERR-6 | TC-003, 020, 027, NF-02 | Low | Fixed + re-tested ✅ | `9c7579a` |
| ERR-7 | TC-019 (also 008, NF-01) | Medium | Fixed + re-tested ✅ | `9c7579a` |

ERR-1, ERR-2, ERR-3, ERR-6 and ERR-7 were defects in the tests, not the product; ERR-5 was a product defect (a deliverable); ERR-4 is a missing value in the data, accepted by the PO as a documented gap. The test plan (QC-owned, approved at G6) still carries the old wording for ERR-1, ERR-2, ERR-3, ERR-4 and ERR-6; its § 6 shell setup and those cases should be updated to match the automation.

## Sign-off

**Decision:** ☐ Validated (counts toward G7) ☐ Returned, reason: {…} · {date}

Open before sign-off: TC-023 (timed check by a person). The certification date (ERR-4) is a documented, PO-accepted gap.
