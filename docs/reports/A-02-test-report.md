# QC Test Report: A-02 Freeze the property-intelligence data contract

Every case in `testplans/A-02-test-cases.md` (v0.2.1, 33 cases: TC-001 to TC-030 and TC-NF-01 to NF-03) was run from the repository root on branch `002-data-contract` (step 0 `git branch --show-current` → `002-data-contract` for every case), at build `f3ddcbe`, with `PILOT_DIR=pipeline/data/pilot/travis-pilot-20261020` set. No code, test, spec or test-plan file was changed.

**How each case was run.** Every case was first run as `pnpm vitest run -t "A-02-TC-0nn"`. Only 13 cases have a test with that title (TC-008, 009, 010, 011, 018, 024, 025, 026, 027, 028 (2 tests), 030, NF-03), all in `packages/query-core/test/acceptance/a02.acceptance.test.ts`; each gave `1 passed` (TC-028: `2 passed`). For the other 20 cases `-t` matched nothing (`379 skipped`). For those, the evidence column names the test that covers the case (`file › title`), which ran in the full verbose run `PILOT_DIR=… pnpm vitest run --reporter=verbose` (24 files, **379 passed**, 0 failed), plus the case's own manual steps (grep, `duckdb` v1.5.6 at `/opt/homebrew/bin/duckdb`, `cat`, and short `pnpm exec tsx` calls to the repo's own functions). TC-029 also ran in the runtime package: `cd pipeline/oracle-runtime && npx vitest run test/pilot/capture-austin.test.ts -t "403"` gave 1 passed.

**Live measure and sample were not re-run.** As instructed, `pnpm --filter ./profiles/travis-austin@1.0.0 measure` (TC-019) and `… sample` (TC-012 / NF-01) were **not** run again, so this QC run made no Austin or Census requests. Their Stage 5 outputs are the evidence: `profiles/travis-austin@1.0.0/expectations.json` (measured 2026-10-20T21:33Z, committed in `0421ac2`) and `docs/evidence/A-02-classifier-review.md` (captured 2026-10-20T21:34Z, PO review D-7).

## Results

"Covering test" means the case has no test under its TC title; the named test was used instead. All named tests passed.

| TC ID | AC | Type | Result | Defect | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-02-TC-001 | AC-1 | Doc / smoke | PASS (see Note 1) | — | Plan grep → `0` (it misses the record's leading `#` column). Same grep allowing `\| n \|` and the verdict column → `9`; rows 1–9 = the 9 fields, verdicts 8 `no_carrier` + 1 `carrier`, no duplicates. Covering test `carriers.test.ts › has exactly the nine AC-1 fields, each with one verdict` ✓ |
| A-02-TC-002 | AC-1 | Integration | PASS | — | Record row 9: `sales_history.ownership_transfer_date`, schema cache `bafkreifxchneb27…gku.json` (file exists, 2,984 B), pilot row `{table: sales_history, cid: baguqeeratr5…bxljh7a}`. `duckdb … WHERE cid = 'baguqeeratr5…bxljh7a'` → 1 row, `1993-12-17`. Covering test `carriers.test.ts › each carrier's pilot row exists in the pilot Parquet with a non-null value` ✓ |
| A-02-TC-003 | AC-1 | Missing data | PASS (see Note 2) | — | `status_raw`: `no_carrier`, fallback "AD-25: Expired published as `improvement_status` null (D-4a); reason `no_lexicon_carrier`", request R1 `property_improvement.permit_status_text`. Status line: "drafted, not filed (PO decision D-1) … D-8 … Not filed". `grep -i filed` → only that line. Contractor state → AD-24 (`resolved`/`unresolved` + five-state totals, R4). All 8 no-carrier rows have a fallback and R1–R6. Covering test `carriers.test.ts › every no-carrier verdict names its fallback (AD-24 or AD-25) and a drafted request` ✓ |
| A-02-TC-004 | AC-1 | Edge | **FAIL** | ERR-9 | Pilot half holds: the only carrier (`ownership_transfer_date`) is a column of `county/sales_history` (`carriers.test.ts › each carrier's pilot row exists…` ✓). Fixture half is missing: no test or checker takes a fixture table without the property and returns `no carrier (not emitted by the export)`; `git grep no_carrier_not_emitted` finds only the verdict list in `carriers.test.ts`. Nearest behaviour: `views.shape.test.ts › fails loudly when an emitted table lacks a column the views read` (throws, does not mark the field). The real-data case is handled by hand: ADR-0002 Decision 3 marks `address` fields `no_carrier_not_emitted`, and `columns.test.ts › address-only fields are not v1 columns; each is listed as not_in_export` ✓ |
| A-02-TC-005 | AC-1 | Edge / error | PASS | — | ADR-0002 § Sources: live MCP tools "**Failed** on 2026-10-20 ("Internal error")… Not used". Each of the 9 rows cites `~/.elephant-cli/schema-cache/<cid>.json` (all 4 cited files exist), plus the live lexicon manifest (sha256 `7084b933…0640`) and the pilot export. `grep -iE "memory\|assumed"` → no verdict hit (the only "Assumption" is the owner-linkage rule in #9, not a verdict source) |
| A-02-TC-006 | FR-011 | Integration | PASS (see Note 3) | — | `ls $PILOT_DIR/reports/` lists the 8 files (+ `sequence.json`, `submit_errors.csv`, `transform-counts.json`). Each `*errors.csv` → `1` line. `shasum`: county `6f16dda9…9c3b`, PI `af7caa18…cdf5`; equal to `reports/sequence.json`, **not** to the run-log values `d989414c…639c` / `72715bf7…084b` (pre-D-9 run). `sequence.json`: 8 steps, all `exitCode 0`, `ok: true`, cli `44bb182b`. `grep -E "upload\|--atlas-page"` run-log → nothing; sequence.json → 0. Tables: county `property` 22 rows; PI `property` 22, `property_improvement` 43. `countyRoot` = hash `carRoot` for both groups (`baguqeerarr6…cssytha`, `baguqeeral3h…zaqq`) |
| A-02-TC-007 | FR-011, AC-8 | Integration | PASS | — | `pnpm exec tsx` with `pipeline/publish/src/cid.ts cidOfFile` → `bafkreibkonskeytl2lqmaoethxvhegzjkwbeon4couanb4x26ng23cs3ka` (starts `bafkrei`) = sample `manifest_cid` (duckdb DISTINCT, 1 value) = run log 02:07. `runId travis-pilot-20261020`, `previousManifestCid null`, limitation "pilot: local, unpublished; …". 23 of 23 `table` artifact CIDs re-derive from their Parquet parts, 0 mismatches. Covering tests `sample.test.ts › manifest_cid = the CID recomputed…`, `views.pilot.test.ts › table_cid equals the re-derived raw-leaves CID of its part`, `manifest.test.ts › accepts the pilot shape` ✓ |
| A-02-TC-008 | AC-2 | Smoke | PASS | — | `PILOT_DIR=… pnpm vitest packages/query-core` → 12 files, 211 passed. `-t "A-02-TC-008"` 1 passed. `views.shape.test.ts › {v_property, v_roofing_permit, v_contractor, v_run} compiles and DESCRIBE equals columns.ts` 4 ✓. All 12 named columns are in `contract/v1/columns.json` |
| A-02-TC-009 | AC-2 | Validation | PASS | — | `-t "A-02-TC-009"` → 1 passed (`enum columns hold only their frozen values`) |
| A-02-TC-010 | AC-2, AC-7 | Negative | PASS | — | `grep -cE '"(status_raw\|expiry_date\|contractor_name_raw\|bbb_rating\|bbb_url\|description\|work_class_raw)"' contract/v1/columns.json` → `0`. Sample rows list each as `{field, reason: no_lexicon_carrier}`. `-t` 1 passed |
| A-02-TC-011 | FR-009 | Static | PASS | — | Plan grep on `views.sql` → no output, exit 1. `-t` 1 passed. Roofing filter `views.sql:308` `pm.improvement_type = 'Roofing' AND pm.improvement_action = 'Replacement'` |
| A-02-TC-012 | AC-3, NFR-001 | Manual + data | PASS (see Note 4) | — | Not re-run (instruction); sheet `docs/evidence/A-02-classifier-review.md`: seed `travis-austin@1.0.0/AC-3/2026-10-21`, population 65,437, keys sha256 `8c729882…4090`, 25 rows.

## Defects

| ERR | TC | Severity | Status | Fix commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ERR-9 | A-02-TC-004 | Low | Open: QC does not fix. The fixture check is missing: nothing takes a table without the cited property and returns `no carrier (not emitted by the export)` with the field left out of every view. The pilot half passes, and real data is handled by hand (ADR-0002 Decision 3 for `address`). The fix is either a small checker plus a fixture test, or a test-plan change approved by the PO that limits TC-004 to the pilot check and the ADR-0002 rule | — |

## Notes

Expected values that are out of date or did not match the plan's wording. Each was judged by what its AC means; none hides a product failure except ERR-9.

1. **TC-001 step 1 grep (test-plan step defect).** `^\| (printed contractor name|…) \|` matches 0 lines, because the carrier table starts with a `#` column (`| 1   | printed contractor name     | no_carrier |`). The verdicts are spelled `carrier`, `no_carrier` and `no_carrier_not_emitted` (ADR-0002 § Verdicts), not `no carrier`. With the column allowed, the count is 9. Fix the grep in test plan v0.2.2. Read literally, step 1's `→ 9` fails.
2. **TC-003 fallback wording.** The plan expects "AD-25: field not published, the UI shows the reason" for `status_raw`. The record says "AD-25: Expired published as `improvement_status` null (D-4a); reason `no_lexicon_carrier`", which reflects PO decision D-4a. Same fallback, same reason.
3. **TC-006 digests out of date (D-9 re-run).** The run log holds the first pilot's `tables-export.json` digests (`d989414c…639c`, `72715bf7…084b`, row 10-21 01:11). The files on disk come from the D-9 re-run (row 10-21 02:07): `6f16dda9…9c3b` and `af7caa18…cdf5`. They match `reports/sequence.json`. The files embed `exportedAt`, so their digests change on every run (`docs/evidence/A-02.md` says so), while the tables roots stay stable. The 02:04 and 02:07 run-log rows do not record the new digests, although `docs/evidence/A-02.md` says "the values per run are in the run log". That is an evidence gap to close in the run log.
4. **TC-012 / NF-01 and TC-019 not re-run (instruction).** The plan expects `measured_at` = today and a same-seed redraw. The committed outputs are from 2026-10-20T21:33Z / 21:34Z (Stage 5). They were judged as committed, so no new Austin traffic was made. Redraw determinism is covered by the unit test.
5. **TC-014 test data.** The pilot EP is `2026-089033 EP`, and its text is "full roof replacement" (include term ROOF REPLACE), not "re-roof". The unit-test EP with "Re-roofing", `2026-131973 EP`, is not a pilot permit. Same AC.
6. **TC-015 "real row" for needs_review.** On 2026-10-21 every `work_class = 'Roof'` row is an EP sign permit, so the test uses the real `2025-061893` description with `permittype` set to BP (the test comment says so). A real EP row would give `trade_permit`.
7. **TC-020 version string.** `gazetteer.version` is `"travis-places@1.0.0"`, not `1.0.0`. It carries version 1.0.0 and its SHA-256.
8. **TC-024 display text.** "not published · no lexicon carrier" is UI text that A-02 does not render. The data carries the reason (`contractor_name_raw` → `no_lexicon_carrier`). The plan's `bbb_status_reason ∈ {contractor_unresolved, no_lexicon_carrier}` holds: all rows are `contractor_unresolved`.
9. **TC-029 details.** The stub blocks the 4th permit GET (`SEPT[3]`), not the 2nd. "No CLI step afterwards" is confirmed by reading the code (`run-pilot.ts:240-241`); no test asserts it. The run's reason names the permit, and the URL is in the blocked receipt.
10. **NF-02 report display.** The text coverage table hides fully covered files, so `packages/contract/src` (100%) and several 100% query-core files do not show in it. The per-directory figures above come from `--coverage.reporter=json-summary` written to a scratch directory. Also, the gazetteer code `packages/query-core/gazetteer/travis-places@1.0.0/index.ts` is outside the coverage `include` glob (`packages/*/src/**`), so it is not counted in query-core coverage. It is exercised by `gazetteer.test.ts` (18 tests ✓).
11. **Test titles.** The plan says "each case maps to one automated Vitest test titled with its TC ID". Only 13 of the 33 cases have one, and the other 20 ran through the covering tests named above. Retitle or add tests, or amend § 7 of the plan.
12. **TC-002 CID prefix.** The cited `sales_history` row CID is `baguqeera…` (dag-json CIDv1), not `bafy…` as the plan's placeholder suggests. It is still CIDv1.
13. **Working tree.** The tree was not clean at the start: `docs/reviews/CR-A-02.md` was already modified. During the run other sessions changed `specs/002-data-contract/run-log.md` and `tasks.md`, and added `docs/evidence/A-02.md` and `docs/reports/A-02-unit-test-report.md`. None of those is a test input except the run log, and the values used from it (manifest CID, D-decisions) are in the committed `HEAD` copy. This QC run changed nothing except this report.
