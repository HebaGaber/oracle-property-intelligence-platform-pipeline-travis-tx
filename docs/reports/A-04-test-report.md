# QC Test Report: A-04 Load the county backbone (FINAL)

**FINAL (second pass, 2026-10-22).** Every case now has a result. Pass 1 ran what needed no database; pass 2 ran the PENDING-DB, PENDING-NETWORK and PASS-PARTIAL steps against the live local stack (Docker Postgres, Restate, services on :9080), read-only except the two Austin cases. Austin was called only by TC-040 (two `count(*)` requests, 2 s apart) and TC-052 (one incremental run, which failed on its second request; ERR-22). GIS, TCAD and `gis.traviscountytx.gov` were not requested; no ingest, write-group, hash or export ran. Database reads used the plan's read-only `qdb_ro` (via `docker exec`, `default_transaction_read_only = on`), never listing owner names. TC-004 also ran the 10-minute join proof once (ERR-23). Two cases FAIL (TC-004 on the CLI output, TC-052 on the live Austin call); ten PASS-WITH-NOTE cases differ from the plan only by a stale expected value or a step not repeatable here (reason in each row).

**Status words.** PASS: every step ran and met the expected result. PASS-WITH-NOTE: the case intent holds; a plan value is stale or one step could not be repeated (stated in the row). FAIL: the product did not meet the expected result (defect filed). In pass 1 a PASS-PARTIAL meant offline steps passed and database or network steps were open; none remain.

**How cases ran.** One command at a time. Both Vitest packages ran once with `-t "A-04-TC-" --reporter=json` and each test was mapped to its case by the id in its name (a test whose title names two cases counts for both). TC-020 was re-run with `GIS_ARTIFACT` set to the stored runner artifact. File-only checks (TC-015 step 2, TC-025 step 3, TC-047 step 2, TC-NF-02, TC-NF-03) ran as the plan's exact shell commands from the repo root, step 0 `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` printing `004-property-backbone`.

## Results

| TC ID | AC | Type | Status | Evidence pointer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-04-TC-001 | AC-1 | Happy path | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Unit steps unchanged. Pilot job already run (not re-run: no ingest). Steps 2, 4, 5, 6 run on the 25 seed pIDs in the live `parcels`: seed 26 lines, anchors in seed `2`, ANCHOR2 log line `1`; `25\|25\|25\|25\|25\|25`; 221829 row `t\|t\|t\|1941\|<TCAD URL>\|2026-10-19 21:33:41.241+00\|64` as expected. Note: ANCHOR2 105471 has no year built (`year_built_missing_reason = source_missing`, rule `none`), so its year cell is empty where the plan says `{year}`; the case allows year or reason. |
| A-04-TC-002 | AC-1 | Happy path | PASS | Vitest TC-002 3 passed (first pass). Steps 1-2 on the pilot County group `travis-a04-pilot-20261021223504`: 22 zips = 22 R accounts of the 25-row seed; `elephant-cli validate` ends `Properties processed: 22, succeeded: 22, failed: 0`. |
| A-04-TC-003 | AC-1 | Negative | PASS | `parcels` 0, `parcel_geoids` 0, permit `1982-012866 BP\|t\|no_tcad_geoid`. |
| A-04-TC-004 | AC-1 | Happy path | FAIL | Steps 1-2 PASS: `221829\|0223120506\|R`; 0 keys outside `^[1-9][0-9]{0,6}$`. Step 3: CLI printed `backbone: ingest failed: fetch failed` after about 5 min (exit 1, no `join_proof=` line) although the workflow completed; result read from the Restate journal of `inv_1eeWoWwOOvDp0v41Yud8lfe5M4KZHXor7j`: `sampled 1000, matched 906, no_tcad_geoid 93, ambiguous_geoid 1, disagreements 0, reverse_checked 1000, reverse_disagreements 0, pass true` (9 min 39 s). Product result correct, CLI output wrong: ERR-23. |
| A-04-TC-005 | AC-2 | Scale | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Step 1 (the ingest) is job `travis-a04-20261022052658`, not re-run. Steps 2-7: classes only `loaded 493246`; 493,246 distinct pIDs; types MH 11,744 / MN 5 / P 39,536 / R 441,961; redacted `R\|15410`; report roll `n 493246, loaded 493246, difference 0, unexplained 0`; limitations hold both §25.025 lines (count 15410). Note: the CLI prints a trailing `job_id=…` line after the JSON, so the plan's `report --json \| jq` pipe stops with a parse error at the last line unless it is stripped. |
| A-04-TC-006 | AC-2 | Scale | PASS | `restate sql`: 242 `TcadBackbone` invocations of the key, all `completed`. `backbone_runs`: `complete\|t\|6f7a7585…2346`. Seed sum 493246, `mergedCount` 493246. |
| A-04-TC-007 | AC-2/FR-018 | Edge | PASS | Vitest 1 passed. Live: `100008\|2\|profile_main`. |
| A-04-TC-008 | FR-019 | Edge | PASS | Vitest 1 passed. Live: one situs shared by 2 accounts, 2 distinct pIDs (`2\|2`). |
| A-04-TC-009 | FR-019 | Edge | PASS | Vitest 1 passed. Live: `1\|6f7a758568fd03fa200e996d2756559eb53e13241238a004cbadac09ff4c2346`. |
| A-04-TC-010 | AC-3 | Happy path | PASS | Vitest 2 passed. Live: `in_county\|f\|393747\|1`, `out_of_area\|t\|57379\|1`, `regional\|t\|8707\|1`, `unknown\|\|33413\|1`; one `area_list_sha256` = DIGEST `0f4c08a8…d5f17f`. |
| A-04-TC-011 | AC-3 | Negative / missing data | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Vitest 4 passed. Step 2 `0`. Step 3 printed `243` (plan: 0): all 243 are `out_of_area` with evidence `foreign_mailing`, R accounts with no ZIP and no `owner_mailing_country` value because the rule also accepts `addrInternational` (`owner-area.ts` header). Evidence is present, so the AC (out_of_area only with evidence) holds; the plan's step 3 predicate is too narrow. |
| A-04-TC-012 | AC-4 | Missing data | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Vitest 2 passed. Live: one row `unknown\|0\|0\|317819\|317819` (plan figure 317,818 is marked re-measured; off by one). |
| A-04-TC-013 | AC-4 | Missing data | PASS | Vitest 4 passed. Live: one row `unknown\|no_roof_date\|source_missing\|92113`. |
| A-04-TC-014 | AC-5 | Security | PASS | `confidential.test.ts` -t TC-014: 2 passed (step order, redaction, limitations). |
| A-04-TC-015 | AC-5 | Security / negative | PASS | Step 2 `0` (first pass). Step 3 `0` for the plan predicate; also `0` for `payload_redacted::text ~* 'ownerName\|addrLine'` on the 15,410 redacted accounts. |
| A-04-TC-016 | AC-6 | Negative / error | PASS | `probes/tcad.test.ts` + `workflow.blocked-a04.test.ts` -t TC-016: 6 passed. |
| A-04-TC-017 | AC-6 | Security | PASS | `workflow.blocked-a04.test.ts` -t TC-017: 5 passed. |
| A-04-TC-018 | FR-025 | Negative / harness | PASS | Vitest 7 passed (first pass). Step 3 overlapping appraisal/permits runs `0`. |
| A-04-TC-020 | AC-7/8 | Scale | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Workflow tests 5 passed and runner-artifact tests 9 passed (first pass). `gh run list -R HebaGaber/…` (the plain command targets the upstream repo and returns 404): runs 39683448743, 39684063596 (full, 373,683 features) and 39685884714 all `success`; 39682166613 earlier `failure`. Pushes (steps 2, 5) not repeated by design. |
| A-04-TC-021 | AC-7 | Negative | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Step 1 `0`. Step 3 `{on_roll:false, coordinate_source:null}` (report anchors). Step 2 printed `f\|f` (plan: `t\|t`): Austin's own row for permit 1982-012866 BP now carries lat/lon 30.2716 / -97.7474 (zip 78701); the plan assumed none (2026-10-19 note). No parcel exists or receives it, so the case intent holds; the plan's step 2 is stale. |
| A-04-TC-022 | AC-7 | Happy path | PASS | Live: `105471\|gis_centroid\|t\|t\|t\|t\|t\|64` and `221829\|gis_centroid\|t\|t\|t\|t\|t\|64`. |
| A-04-TC-023 | AC-8 | Scale / missing data | PASS-WITH-NOTE | Steps 1-3 live: `condo-coded\|70609\|20071\|24566\|46043`, `ordinary\|371352\|369990\|370027\|1325` (99.63%); R reasons all present (`no_gis_feature` 46,945, `no_permit_point` 423, 0 no-point rows without a reason); P 39,536 / MH 11,744 / MN 5 all `none`. Report: 441,961 R, 394,593 with point (0.8928). Step 4 not re-run: the combined export-tables folder (`hashrun/combined2/…`) is no longer on disk and rebuilding it needs hash/export (forbidden here); its result is the run-log 12:21 entry (v_property 441,961 = 441,961, gate PASS, 0.8826 / 0.8928). |

## Sign-off

**Decision:** pending QC Lead. Every case has a result: 50 pass (10 with a note), 2 fail. Not ready for G7 until ERR-22 (incremental run against the real Austin source) and ERR-23 (join-proof CLI output) are fixed and TC-052 / TC-004 are re-run, or the PO accepts them as exceptions. The plan values that moved with the sources (TC-021 step 2, TC-045 open split, TC-046 day count, TC-011 step 3, TC-012 count) are listed in the rows for a v0.4 plan edit.
