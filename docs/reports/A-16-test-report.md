# QC Test Report: A-16 Prove zero idle cost, run the pipeline from the hosted app, and close the carried gaps

## Read this first

- Every result was measured on the **hosted** preview or API, never on localhost. Data cases run on the latest full-county run, Run 3 (`travis-full-run3-20261025`, manifest above).
- **Skipped:** the run-command cases that need the bridge on the operator machine (TC-013, TC-014, TC-018) are skipped because the PO put the live bridge test on hold until Run 3.1 is done. TC-015 and TC-019 are operator-driven and also skipped. Their infrastructure half is proven by CDK tests.
- The parity cases TC-023 to TC-033 have no Playwright file. They were checked by hosted side-by-side review against the boards at 390, 768 and 1440 px (`docs/evidence/A-16-prototype-parity.md`). Remaining differences are features the product does not have; they are a recorded PO exception.
- The project CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the A-13 hosted shards and the workspace checks, not the a16 projects. The a16 projects were run by hand against the preview.

### Part 3 · Prototype parity (AC-12), hosted review

| TC ID                      | Board family                                                                                            | Result                          | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| A-16-TC-023 to A-16-TC-033 | Shell/Hub, Explore, ExploreQ, Data, Runs, Coverage, Help MCP, Legal, Coming soon, AdminSignIn, Activity | PASS by review (not Playwright) | `docs/evidence/A-16-prototype-parity.md`: final review on preview `03c0ebc`, 21 match, 6 justified, 25 differ on 52 cells (was 10/6/36); no horizontal scroll at 390/768/1440. The 25 differences are board features the product does not have (AI three-pane with editable chips, Save, Area/Sort dropdowns, Manifest pager, Verify chips, Gantt, heatmap, reconciliation): PO exception "parity beyond the style-only scope". The ExploreQ SQL state is gone with the SQL tab (PO, `fa09e69`) |

### Part 3 · Full-county index (AC-13) and closure (AC-14) (`A-16-county.spec.ts`, `A-16-closure.spec.ts`)

| TC ID       | AC    | Result | What the pass shows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A-16-TC-034 | AC-13 | PASS   | README searches on Run 3, 20 timed calls each after a warm-up: p95 radius + roof 976 ms, open permits 1,245 ms, tenure 976 ms, out-of-area owner 545 ms (answers "owner area not published", no rows); no 5xx. `img/A-16-TC-034-full-county-radius-roof.png`          |
| A-16-TC-035 | AC-13 | PASS   | Real Bedrock calls: D-10 answered in 10.5 s with 50 cited rows (Run 3 provenance); D-11 answered in 6.2 s with 0 rows (`empty_in_scope`, an honest "nothing in scope"). `img/A-16-TC-035-d10-answered.png`, `img/A-16-TC-035-d11-answered.png`                        |
| A-16-TC-036 | AC-13 | PASS   | MCP `search_properties` on Run 3: 200 in 1.37 s, 50 rows of 75,432 with provenance; same `property_cid` set and total as `explore.search`                                                                                                                             |
| A-16-TC-037 | AC-13 | PASS   | Every `table_cid` in returned rows is a table artifact of the Run 3 manifest. Limit: the index header is in private S3, so "no CID missing from the index" is checked at build time by the index tool's `--verify` (`docs/evidence/A-16.md` Part 3), not by this test |
| A-16-TC-038 | AC-14 | PASS   | The only parks left (A-13 TC-053, A-13 TC-081, A-03 TC-034) are recorded exceptions in the Closure table. It checks the sources; the unparked cases' results come from the hosted CI shards                                                                           |
| A-16-TC-039 | AC-14 | PASS   | Both Closure tables list the same 33 IDs; every Closed row names evidence that exists in the repo; every Exception has a reason (first run found 11 rows without a pointer, fixed in the evidence doc)                                                                |
| A-16-TC-040 | AC-14 | PASS   | A synthetic table with a missing ID, a Closed row without evidence and an Exception without a reason gives exactly those three issues (`tests/e2e/lib/closure.test.ts`)                                                                                               |

| A-16-TC-NF-03 | PASS   | Activity timing within the budget (pickup timing needs the bridge, on hold)                                                                                                                  |
| A-16-TC-NF-04 | PASS   | The access token is in neither page text nor console; axe has no serious or critical issue on sign-in, Runs and Activity, after the Runs loading placeholder got `role="status"` (`871664d`) |
