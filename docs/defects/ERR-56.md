# ERR-56: Data · Catalog showed no tables for a batched run

## Root cause

`catalogTables` only understood the pilot layout `tables/<group>/<table>/<part>`. Run 2 (A-11) publishes 225 table parts under export batches (`pipeline/data/runs/…/county-batched/tables/b01/<table>/<part>`), so every part was skipped and the Catalog listed 0 tables.

## Fix

`apps/web/src/data/parquet-meta.ts`: a part's table is its parent folder and its group is the one query-core's `resolveBatchGroups` resolves for its batch, so a table split over batches is one row and the pilot layout still works. Tests use the committed Runs 1 and 2.

## Impact

Data · Catalog (AC-10) was empty on the full county. Now 26 tables; footers load in about 50 s from a laptop.
