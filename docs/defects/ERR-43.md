# ERR-43: Help · MCP content area scrolls sideways at 390 px (main scrollWidth 693)

## Brief description

Final `smeargle` pass on the preview (build `015fbf9`): `/help/mcp` at 390 px fails; 80 of 81 page × width cells pass. `main` (a scroll container, `overflow-x: auto`) has `scrollWidth` 693 against `clientWidth` 390. The document and body stay at 390, so a body-only check (and the Playwright no-horizontal-scroll cases) do not see it.

## Root cause

Each setup snippet sits in a plain `<div>` inside a CSS grid card. A grid item's automatic minimum width is its content's min-content, here the unwrapped `<pre>` (677 px), so the track grew past the viewport even though `.snippet` has `overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%`.

## Fix

`HelpMcp.module.css` `.snippetBox { min-width: 0 }` on the wrapper (used by `HelpMcp.tsx`), so the code block scrolls inside itself.

## Regression test

`apps/web/test/touch-targets.test.ts` "N3" (red before, green after). Hosted re-check: `/help/mcp` at 390 on the next build, and TC-042/TC-080.

## Impact

At phone width the whole Help · MCP page could be dragged sideways; no data was affected.
