# ERR-28: Coverage hosted test – demands a table chip on a kind that has no published table

## Brief description

First hosted run of A-13 against the preview (build `641bc25`). This is a **test defect**.

## Related requirement

- **Story:** A-13 · **AC:** A-13-AC-2 · **Requirement:** FR-002 · **Test case:** A-13-TC-016

## Environment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| URL | https://013-explorer-and-pages.d2lx0utip89u18.amplifyapp.com |
| Build | `641bc25` (preview build) |
| Data snapshot | manifest `bafkreiasycmsr2qdlxqcfg3yc2conpn3jxmohz7gs55hkseipplhpqsk5i` |
| Browser / OS / device | Playwright Chromium (desktop; 390 for the touch-target cases) |

## Steps to reproduce

Run `tests/e2e/A-13-*.spec.ts` case `@scenario:A-13-TC-016` with RUNTIME_URL set to the preview.

## Expected result

Each record kind shows its published table, or a reason (AC-2, FR-007).

## Actual result

Key #21 (contractor_*): "the kind's table chip" not found. Contractor states are the run's internal match; the page shows "no published table for this kind in this run".

## Root cause

Test defect: stricter than AC-2, which allows a stated reason. The page is correct.

## Fix

expectKindTable accepts a chip whose CID is in M, or (kind without table) the reason text.

## Regression test

tests/e2e/A-13-explorer.spec.ts @scenario:A-13-TC-016 (hosted)

## Resolution
