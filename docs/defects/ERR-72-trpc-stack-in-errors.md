# ERR-72: tRPC error responses carried a server stack trace

## Brief description

The first smoke after the A-16 deploy (`GET /trpc/admin.me` signed out) answered the correct 401, but the JSON error body included `data.stack` with internal file paths (`/apps/api/src/handlers/trpc.ts:249`, node_modules paths). Present since A-03: `initTRPC.create()` defaults `isDev` to `NODE_ENV !== "production"`, and the Lambdas do not set `NODE_ENV`, so every tRPC error in production carried its stack.

## Impact

No secret or token was exposed (the stack holds code paths only), but internal structure leaks to any caller, and the evaluator would see it on any error state.

## Fix

`apps/api/src/trpc.ts`: `initTRPC.context<Context>().create({ isDev: false })`, so error bodies never include `stack`. A unit test asserts no `stack` field on a refused admin call.

## Re-test

After the next `CountyLensApi` deploy: `GET /trpc/admin.me` signed out → 401 with no `stack` in the body.
