# Source access decisions (A-01)

The rules these decisions touch: FR-006a (never retry a 403 or a challenge, never change identity or network address), FR-006b and AC-6 (a US-runner check only on geo-block evidence), ARD § 8, and `research.md` R10 (a VPN counts as IP rotation and is forbidden).

## D-1. The 2026-10-19 live run went through a VPN (deviation, found in review)

- **What happened:** the operator machine was connected to a VPN during the 2026-10-19 discovery runs (`travis`, `travis-2`). This was not known to the run, and it was not recorded at intake: intake item 5 recorded the egress as `EG` from a check made outside the run.
- **What the receipts show:** Cloudflare edge codes in the saved responses are mixed within the same minute: `LHR` (TCAD export 21:01, Cedar Park 21:09:16.263, Leander 21:09:26) and `CAI` (BBB 21:08:55, Creedmoor 21:09:16.768). An edge code is not an exit address, so the exit address per request cannot be reconstructed.
- **Effect:** every 2026-10-19 request was made with the project User-Agent and one attempt, and none was repeated within that run. But the run's egress was not the operator's own network, which R10 does not allow.
- **Decision:** recorded as a deviation. From 2026-10-20 every request-sending command checks and records the egress country first and refuses on a mismatch (finding OR-B1 in `docs/reviews/CR-A-01.md`). No 2026-10-19 result is relied on where a later request from the operator's own network exists.

## D-2. One US-runner count request for the county GIS layer (approved)

- **Evidence:** from the operator's own network (VPN off, egress `EG`), the GIS host `gis.traviscountytx.gov` resolves but never accepts a TCP connection, while `www.traviscountytx.gov` on the same domain answers HTTP 200 in about 1 s (`docs/evidence/blocked/tcad_gis-20261020T072223Z.md`).
- **Rule change:** FR-006b required a geo signal in the source's own response. The PO accepted the pattern above (no TCP connection from non-US egress while a sibling host on the same domain answers) as **suspected** geo evidence for one count request from a US GitHub Actions runner. FR-006b and AC-6 are amended with this clause.
- **What was done:** one identified request, same URL and User-Agent, no retry: HTTP 200, `{"count":373683}` ([run 39387019700](https://github.com/HebaGaber/oracle-property-intelligence-platform-pipeline-travis-tx/actions/runs/39387019700); body and SHA-256 kept in `docs/evidence/A-01-us-gis-runner.md`, the lasting record, since the run's artifact expires after 30 days). The workflow is disabled so it cannot fire again.
- **Not decided here:** paging GIS coordinates from a US runner in A-05 adds an execution venue (ARD rule 10); that needs its own decision in A-05.

## D-3. BBB and GIS were requested again from a different network (deviation)

- **What happened:** on 2026-10-20, at the PO's direction, two blocked sources were requested once more from the operator's own network (VPN off), after their 2026-10-19 attempts had gone through the VPN:
  - GIS count query at 07:22:23Z: timed out again (TCP connect never completed).
  - BBB at 07:23:23Z: the same Cloudflare challenge (HTTP 403, `cf-mitigated: challenge`). Nothing was solved or bypassed.
  - San Leanna's evidence page at 08:53:13Z (`reprobe-jurisdictions`): HTTP 406 again. Its body says the request was blocked by Mod Security, the site's web application firewall, so it was a block, not the content-negotiation refusal the run first assumed (finding OR-M2). The other three re-probes that day (Austin network error, Bee Cave and Rollingwood 404) were not blocks under FR-006.
- **Rules broken:** FR-006 counts a timeout as `blocked`, and FR-006a forbids retrying a blocked source with a changed network address. For BBB, AC-6 and FR-006a also say a challenge is never retried. FR-006f allows one more attempt only with the same identity. The earlier evidence text "no retry with a changed identity was made" was wrong for both requests and has been corrected.
- **Why it happened:** for GIS and BBB, the PO wanted to know whether the VPN caused the blocks. It did not: both answered the same way from the operator's own network. For San Leanna, the 406 was misread as a request-format problem; the re-probe command now treats a firewall-block body as a block and refuses it.
- **Decision:** recorded as a deviation. No further BBB or GIS requests from the operator machine in A-01; BBB stays `blocked`, and GIS was counted through D-2.

## D-4. No records requests or API applications are filed

- **Decision:** the PO files no records request, Public Information Act request or API application (including the BBB API) in this project. Every blocked or records-request row says why, what was tried, and what would unblock it, with "not filed (PO decision 2026-10-20)". The `records_request` blocks stay as documentation of the lawful route, as the validator requires.
- **Reason:** the PO will discuss these limits with the evaluator rather than do official work outside the build.

## D-5. The superseded durable run `travis` was killed

- Run `travis` (2026-10-19T20:40Z) was replaced by `travis-2`, which wrote the catalog. `travis` stayed suspended in `WAITING_HUMAN`, and `resolve` targeted it by default, so one `resolve` would have rewritten the catalog from its 2026-10-19 journal (finding CR-3 / OR-M1).
- A cancel (2026-10-20T14:14:47Z) could not complete: the code had changed since the run started, so its journal no longer replayed ("journal mismatch"). It was killed through the local Restate admin API at 2026-10-20T14:15:06Z (`[409] killed`). The catalog was unchanged (SHA-256 `31ea8fab…`). Run `travis-2` is completed.
