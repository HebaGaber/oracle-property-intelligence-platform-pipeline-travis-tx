# G7 pre-check (run 2): A-03 Publish one month of Austin roofing permits by CID and show them in the hosted UI

This is an AI completeness pre-check. It reports gaps only and does not approve. The PO records the decision.

## Run 2 note

Run 1 (2026-10-21, branch at `fe2b26a`, not pushed) was **FAIL with 6 FAILs**:

- **C-01:** T078, T079, TZ02, TZ03 and TZ06 were unticked (no green `ci` run for T078, no quickstart section for T079, no GitHub token decision recorded for TZ02).
- **C-02:** no `ci` run on the branch had passed (39638006386 in progress, two earlier runs failed).
- **C-03:** the CR Runs table held a template placeholder row, OR-3 and OR-11 were "deferred to G7" and still open, and the 14 commits after `327c11f` had no reviewer pass.
- **C-04:** the test report did not record the run-3 TC-051 and TC-061 results, was `Draft`, and pointed at an old unit-test report.
- **C-05:** ERR-10 to ERR-19 were `Re-tested`, not `Closed`.
- **C-08:** the A-03 traceability row was stale (42/43, ERR-19 open), and the gate log had no A-03 G4, G5 or G6 rows.

The run-log at 20:11 records the fixes. This run checks each one against the files, not against the run-log.

**Inputs read:** `specs/003-walking-skeleton/tasks.md`, `specs/003-walking-skeleton/run-log.md`, `docs/reports/A-03-unit-test-report.md`, `docs/reports/A-03-test-report.md`, `docs/reviews/CR-A-03.md`, `docs/defects/ERR-10.md` to `ERR-19.md`, `docs/evidence/A-03.md`, `docs/traceability.md`, `docs/kit-usage.md`, `stories/A-03-walking-skeleton.md`, `git log feature/oracle-pipeline..HEAD` (27 commits), `gitleaks git` over the same range, `gh run list … --branch 003-walking-skeleton --limit 3` (read twice, 17:39Z and about 17:40Z) and `gh run view 39641644469`.

| Check | Criterion | Result | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-01 | Tasks done | PASS | `tasks.md`: 92 task lines, all `[x]`, 0 `[ ]` (T001–T086, TZ01–TZ06, including T078, T079, TZ02, TZ03 and TZ06). |
| C-02 | Unit tests | PASS | Unit report attached (local at `fe2b26a`: workspace 1,071 / 0 / 6, runtime 647 / 0 / 0, infra 84 / 0 / 0; coverage `query-core` lines 96.15 % / branches 90.28 %, `contract` 100 %, both ≥ 80 %). **CI:** run [39641644469](https://github.com/HebaGaber/oracle-property-intelligence-platform-pipeline-travis-tx/actions/runs/39641644469) on `5fbc811` (headSha verified) is `success` with all four jobs green (workspace, oracle-runtime, gitleaks, e2e-hosted). The runs on HEAD `7563084` (39645623413) and on `3deb5e8` (39645576534) were **still in progress** when this was read (gitleaks ✓, workspace and oracle-runtime running). The commits after `5fbc811` remove `pipeline-ci.yml` and tick boxes in docs only. Non-blocking: the unit report's `ci_run` field and its last paragraph still say "No green `ci` run exists yet". |
| C-03 | Code review | PASS | Both `agents.reviewers` re-scored at `fe2b26a` (§ "Delta review"): oracle **90/100** and metagross **86/100**, both ≥ 75, no Critical or Major findings. The `/code-review` (high, `570285d`) found 0 Critical and 4 Major, all fixed in `327c11f`. "Open Critical findings: 0". OR-3 and OR-11 are re-targeted to A-11 with reasons. Non-blocking: the Runs table stops at row 6 (81/100 at `327c11f`), and the front matter `reviewed_commit` still names `327c11f`. Adding rows 7–8 (the delta reviews at `fe2b26a`) keeps the log self-consistent. |
| C-04 | TC executed on hosted URL | PASS | `A-03-test-report.md`: "**Final tally: 43 / 43 cases passed on the hosted runtime across runs 2–3**". 39 cases count from run 2 on `fbdb68b` and 4 from run 3 on `86694cc` (TC-050, TC-NF-04, TC-051, TC-061). Each row names its build. "No case ran on localhost", and TC-060 refuses localhost. The Summary points at the regenerated unit report. The PO's "Validated" tick in the sign-off is a G7 decision. |
| C-05 | Defects closed | PASS | ERR-10 to ERR-19 are all `status: Closed` with `closed_date: 2026-10-21` and "☒ Closed". ERR-10 to ERR-18 were re-tested PASS in run 2, and ERR-19 in run 3 (cold start 2,525 ms). The harness defects (TC-041, 043, 050, 051) are documented as test fixes. |
| C-06 | No open Critical | PASS | No A-03 defect is Critical, all are Closed, and CR-A-03 has 0 open Critical findings. |
| C-07 | Evidence | PASS | `docs/evidence/A-03.md` has the hosted URL and builds, manifest CID `bafkreiasycmsr2qdlxqcfg3yc2conpn3jxmohz7gs55hkseipplhpqsk5i`, the observed counts (38 / 35 / 3; 27 artifacts), `verify-manifest` ALL ARTIFACTS VERIFIED (28/28 on Pinata and Filebase), Playwright reports and screenshots, spike p95 and hosted Lambda p95 (radius 200 ms, roofAge 95 ms), TC-NF-04 (cold 2,525 ms, warm p95 243 ms), the log line with correlation `FmoW9j89Ai0EJQg=`, X-Ray trace `1-6ad8edc5-40a028cb6df370d02e8422da`, CDK assertions (TC-052), the CI link (§ CI (T078)), the concurrency finding (AD-11, no reserved concurrency), the quickstart check (T079) and the token decision (TZ02). Non-blocking staleness: the line 16 banner "**Status: DRAFT** … TC-051 re-runs … after this update", the same phrase at line 63, and the older § CI table ("`fbdb68b` (HEAD)", "No `ci` run is green on this branch yet"), which § CI (T078) further down supersedes. |
| C-08 | Traceability | PASS | The A-03 row in `docs/traceability.md` (line 93) records 43/43 across runs 2–3, ERR-10 to ERR-19 Closed and the manifest CID. The gate log has the A-03 G4, G5 and G6 rows (lines 113–115). The `kit-usage.md` A-03 row is complete. Non-blocking: both rows still quote the review scores as "oracle 88/100, metagross 81/100 at `327c11f`" (now 90 and 86 at `fe2b26a`), the traceability row says "branch @ `fe2b26a`" (HEAD `7563084`), and kit-usage says "TC-010 and TC-020 PASS in hosted run 2" rather than 43/43. |
| C-09 | Commits | PASS | All 27 commits in `feature/oracle-pipeline..HEAD` start with `A-03: `. `gitleaks git` over the 27 commits: "no leaks found". |
| C-10 | Story status | PASS | `status: Ready`, `gate: G6`, `qc_testability_signoff: true`. It can be set to `Done` / `gate: G7` once the PO approves. The PO decisions are in the run-log: ✋ A-5 "looks right" (19:05) and the token "Keep for now" (expires by 2026-10-28, 20:11), which is recorded as the PO's decision under constitution XII. |

**Verdict: PASS** (0 FAILs, 10/10).

## Fix list (non-blocking cleanups, ordered by impact on the assessment score)

1. **CI on HEAD:** confirm that runs 39645623413 (`7563084`) and 39645576534 (`3deb5e8`) finish green before the merge. If either fails, open an ERR and re-run this pre-check.
2. **Stale review scores:** in `docs/traceability.md` row 93 and the `docs/kit-usage.md` A-03 row, write "oracle 90/100, metagross 86/100 at `fe2b26a`". Add Runs rows 7–8 to `CR-A-03.md` and update its `reviewed_commit`.
3. **Stale evidence and unit-report text:** remove "Status: DRAFT" and "TC-051 re-runs … after this update" (evidence lines 16 and 63). Mark the old § CI table as history. Set the unit report's `ci_run` to run 39641644469.
4. Update the traceability branch SHA to the final HEAD, and make kit-usage say 43/43.

When the PO approves: tick the G7 checklist in the story, set `status: Done` and `gate: G7`, record the decision and the date, and add the G7 row to the gate log in `docs/traceability.md`. Then merge with `--no-ff` and run `bash scripts/progress.sh`.
