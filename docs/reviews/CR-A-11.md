Reviewer findings already closed in A-11:

| Finding | Fixed in |
| --- | --- |
| oracle M1: permits path accepted a pre-fix stored copy | `1fc994a` |
| oracle M2: batch split reused by file names only | `1fc994a` |
| oracle M3: fingerprint missed output-shaping files | `1fc994a` |
| oracle L1: gate `NOT IN` NULL hole, no count required, local parts unhashed | `1fc994a` |
| porygon: Run 2 manifest carried Run 1's "(17387 rows)" | `03a6f29` (publish stopped before the manifest; rebuilt) |
| machamp M1: no index rollback on failed verification | `e42000e` |
| machamp M2: receipts/index not written atomically | `e42000e` |
| machamp M3: Release attached CARs without a hash check | `e42000e` |

| A-16 #6: permit-link reconciliation check (made required for real runs) | `5c34ec5`, `6dea9be` |

Reviewer findings carried to `stories/A-16-cost-and-admin.md` item #8 (Runs-page "superseded" cue, a code check for `permits_trade_sub_permit`, fingerprint from real imports, stray-folder removal, gateway-confirmation receipts).

## 2. `/code-review medium` on `421e888^..1ff21aa`

Scope: code only. `runs/`, logs, receipts and fixture JSON were excluded; the logs were grepped for credentials (none found). No verify pass was run on these findings.

| # | Severity | File:line | Finding | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | High | `pipeline/publish/src/gateway-readback.ts:136` | `gatewaysAgree` passes when one gateway confirms and the other is only "inconclusive" (403/429). Pinata blocks automated clients, so "both gateways" (AM-01) can pass on Filebase's own gateway alone, and the CLIs still print "both gateways served it back". | Open: needs a PO call on the verification policy (count Pinata 403/429 as unverified, or record "single-gateway" honestly). Ties to A-16 #4 |
| 2 | High | `pipeline/publish/src/manifest.ts:469` | `assertPermitLinkReconciliation` returns silently when any of the five exclusion keys is missing, or when the Austin source isn't found, so `requireLinkedPermits`' "always runs" can be bypassed. | Open: fail instead of skipping for a real run |
| 3 | Medium | `pipeline/local-stack/scripts/run-lock.ts:39` (same in `batch-hash-validate-export.sh` `acquire_lock`) | Stale-lock takeover is check-then-delete: two contenders can both take the lock and corrupt the hashed group directory. | Open: take over atomically (rename/link) |
| 4 | Medium | `pipeline/oracle-runtime/travis/permits/write-group.ts:133` | The permits path always passes the assembled coordinate. The County writer passes it only when coordinates are assembled (`tcad-backbone.ts:228`), and keeps an export point whose kind is null. Before GIS assembly the two groups' geometry would differ again. | Open: latent today (Run 2's DB is fully assembled; the identity gate passed). Mirror the County's `assembled` rule |
| 5 | Medium | `pipeline/publish/src/run-manifest.ts:187` | Stale-coverage detection fires only when `permits_emitted` changes. A correction with the same row count carries every other base coverage key unchanged. | Open → A-16 (Run 3+) |
| 6 | Medium | `pipeline/local-stack/scripts/reexport-permits.ts:332` | Folders for pIDs not in the current `--pids` list are never removed from the hashed group directory. | Carried: A-16 #8 (stray-folder removal). Run 2's group dir was checked by hand: 10,792 folders, no strays |
| 7 | Medium | `pipeline/local-stack/scripts/reexport-permits.ts:76` | The reuse fingerprint is a hand list of files plus `content_sha256`/`captured_at`; unlisted helpers or other `property_improvements` columns can change without invalidating a folder. | Carried: A-16 #8 (fingerprint from real imports) |
| 8 | Low | `pipeline/publish/src/gateway-readback.ts:39` | `readbackWhole` buffers whole CARs (~230 MB) per gateway under a fixed 300 s timeout. | Carried: A-16 #8 (gateway-confirmation receipts; stream the hash) |
| 9 | Low | `apps/web/src/engine/load-permits.ts:158` | The prefetch now waits for the duckdb-wasm chunk just to call `permitsPartNames`, putting that download before the parts fetch that ERR-17 ran in parallel. | Open: take `boundPartNames`/`PERMITS_VIEWS` from `@countylens/query-core`; matters for the 8 s first-load target |
| 10 | Low | `pipeline/publish/src/publish-run.ts:899` | When every CAR is reused from `--release-reuse-tag` and the run's own release doesn't exist, `release.json` still records the run's tag. | Not hit by Run 2 (5 new CARs, release created). Open → A-16 |

## 3. Summary

All six reviewer-agent scores pass the bar (latest: 88, 86, 82, 80, 80, 92). The `/code-review medium` pass found no defect in the published Run 2 data: the identity gate passed before upload and again from the CID copy. Findings #1 and #2 weaken checks that are meant to be hard guarantees, and #9 affects the first-load target. Each needs a fix in A-11 or an explicit carry decision before G7.


## 4. Run 3 correction commits, `/code-review medium` (2026-10-25)

Range `60b60f8..HEAD` (roof date from the ledger, owner-name parsing for ERR-62, owner-area view, identity gate against the previous run, finished-permit open_days for ERR-63, plus the committed work files). No Critical finding. Ten findings, triaged by the PO's close decision (A-11 closes without Run 3, so none of this code has published data yet):

| # | Severity | Where | Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Medium | `owner-name.ts:379` | The entity-word test runs before the structured firstName/lastName check, so a person with a surname such as Co, Bank or Church can be written as a company. | Open, carried to A-16 item 16. The code comment states the order as intended (ERR-62); it needs a check against real TCAD owners before Run 3 changes it. |
| 2 | Medium | `write-group.ts:415` | County roof_date reads the mutable `roof_age_estimates` table, so the County CIDs depend on DB state, and a malformed ledger row aborts a flush. | Open, A-16 item 16. Resolve before Run 3 publishes the County group. |
| 3 | Low | `bind-manifest.ts:112` | `meta.address_zip` coverage could be mislabelled if only some batches carry postal_code. | Open, A-16 item 16. Not reachable with the current export. |
| 4 | Low | `tcad-county.ts:660` | `mailing_address_fallback` is counted once per person, not once per printed address. | Open, A-16 item 16. |
| 5 | Low | `owner-name.ts:432` | A trailing "&" with no second party counts as a skipped co-owner. | Open, A-16 item 16. |
| 6 | Medium | `identity-gate.ts:972` | The previous run is bound with the current table list and falls back to remote part downloads with no timeout. | Open, A-16 item 16. Fix before Run 3. |
| 7 | Medium | `verify-manifest.ts:1244` | `--sample` exits 0 like a full verification. | Open, A-16 item 16. Not used for any claim in A-11 (Run 1 evidence names its gateways and counts). |
| 8 | Low | `.claude/settings.json` | Shared settings now allow-list commands with stale process IDs. | PO chose "commit everything" on 2026-10-25. Recorded; clean up in A-16. |
| 9 | Low | `elephant-cli5/6/7.log` | About 32 MB of debug logs committed at the repo root. | Same PO choice. Recorded; they stay in history. |
| 10 | Low | `derive.ts:156` | `openDaysReason` without `asOf` can disagree with the SQL macro. | Open, A-16 item 16. |

Reviewer-agent scores for these commits are in section 5.

## 5. Run 3 correction commits, reviewer-agent scores (2026-10-25)

Scope: `git diff origin/feature/oracle-pipeline...e6288bc` (the Run 3 corrections, contract v1.1 and the publish tooling). All four `agents.reviewers` ran read-only on the same diff. Pass bar 75.

| Agent | Score | Lens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| oracle | 76 | mining and publication correctness, provenance, CIDv1 immutability |
| donphan | 78 | the published data as a consumer reads it |
| machamp | 78 | publish tooling: idempotency, resume, locks, retries |
| porygon | 72, re-score after its finding 1: 80 (R1 resolved; R2 to R11 as A-16 item 17) | metric definitions and run-to-run comparison |

| # | Agent | Severity | Where | Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | porygon | High | `apps/web/src/routes/Runs.tsx:189` | Each source showed its delta and watermark twice (a Run 3 line duplicated A-13's `SourceDeltas`, and ignored `firstRun`). | Fixed in this commit: one delta line (`SourceDeltas`, honours first run), watermark once; test updated. |
| R2 | oracle | High | `austin-property-improvement.ts:342` | A contractor `company` and edge are written from the printed permit name; a consumer can read the edge as a resolved contractor. | PO decision 2026-10-25 ("as printed, unverified"); `contractor_resolution` stays unresolved and the company has no registry id. Already published in Run 3. A-16 item 17: record as a lexicon gap in an ADR. |
| R3 | oracle | Medium-High | `tcad-county.ts:332` | Deed-derived `sales_history` rows add `transfer_source=["deed"]` to the TCAD export request, so `source_http_request` no longer matches the request made. | Already published in Run 3 (CIDs never change). A-16 item 17: keep the exact request and record deed versus sale elsewhere, from Run 4. |
| R4 | oracle, machamp | Medium | `publish-run.ts:651`, `car-files.ts:126` | A Filebase-only readback receipt does not say Pinata was deferred, so a later run would skip the Pinata check. | A-16 item 14 and 17: write `deferredGateways` in the receipt. |
| R5 | machamp, oracle | High / Low | `publish-run.ts:417`, `482` | Per-unit lock race (pid written after create; stale-lock takeover by rm) and receipt check before the lock. | The Run 3 workers have finished; all 30 uploads have receipts, and uploads are content-addressed, so the worst case was a duplicate upload. A-16 item 17. |
| R6 | machamp | Medium | `run3/p9-worker*.sh` | The worker scripts log the exit code of `date`, not of the upload. | Every unit was confirmed by its receipt, not by the worker's exit line. A-16 item 17. |
| R7 | donphan | Medium | `bbb-search-url.ts:111` | The BBB link uses `find_type=Category` and nobody has clicked one. | ERR-66 stays Open until the PO checks one link. The link is built in the view, so a fix needs no new run. |
| R8 | donphan, porygon | Medium | `run-manifest.ts:152`, `:355` | Manifest coverage notes still say every permit is unresolved and do not count the new fields; a new source (address points) shows "added 466,149". | Run 3's manifest is published. A-16 item 17: manifest builder, from Run 4. |
| R9 | donphan | Medium | `address-points.ts:97` | A condo point is matched by house number and street only; no city check. | A-16 item 17: match within the situs city and report rejects. |
| R10 | porygon | Medium / Low | `run-log.md:101`, ERR-64 | Roof age, owners and tenure change their basis between Run 2 and Run 3; Run 2 tenure is 175,408 in one place and 175,406 in another. | The evidence table marks the basis change; A-16 item 17 settles the 2-row gap. |
| R11 | others | Low | various | Retry scope, `OWNER_PERSONS` not stamped in the manifest, partial-worker status, Filebase retry load, one company per permit, `bbb_blocked` wording, v_contractor notes. | A-16 item 17. |
